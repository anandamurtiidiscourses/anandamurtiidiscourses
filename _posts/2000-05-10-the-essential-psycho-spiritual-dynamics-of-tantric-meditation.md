Meditation is the process of converting objectivity into subjectivity, or,
transforming existential limitations and bondages into the pristine purity of
Consciousness. This is indeed the Tantric definition of yoga: the union of
the microcosmic consciousness with the Macrocosmic Consciousness. It is
the gradual realization of our oneness with the Infinite. Within the chitta
are the samskaras in the form of thoughts, feelings, actions, experiences,
and sensations. The subjective sphere of mind is the Aham and Mahat.
Recall that the Aham is the feeling of active doer-ship or ego- the part of
the mind that has a subjective identification with the contents of the
objective chitta. For example, if the chitta has constantly experienced the
impressions of life in the United States- the cultural norms and mores, the
sense of national and cultural identity, a particular socio-economic class,
etc. The subjective ego identifies itself with these impressions and feels
that itself, a subject, is associated with its external experiences. However,
the ego is a midpoint between objectivity and pure subjectivity in that the
ego does not in itself constitute the subjective identity. The Mahat is the
component of mind with the pure feeling that "I exist." It is not qualified by
external impressions but simply gives the sense of subjective identity to the
Aham. It is this deep feeling of existential identity that initially inspires the
mind to discover what it truly is. When Mahat is manifest, one realizes that
the “I” is not the ego, that there is a inner peace and purity that is not
touched by thought or action. The Mahat is an inner, quiescent, and tranquil
feeling of existence unperturbed by anything external or Aham-oriented.
When the personality or Aham is aligned with the Mahat one is in an
internal, spiritual flow. The Mahat itself is not the final subjective entity,
however. The mind is "an ever-changing, functional, relative entity." Mind
is impermanent, a creation under the influence of Shakti, as well as an
entity destined to merge again with Shiva, thus losing its separate identity.
Shiva itself is the fundamental "I", the Knower of mind. Recall that Shiva
is a singular entity and is the subjective Witness of the microcosm as well
as the Macrocosm. Mahat is a near-perfect replica that serves as the link to
Shiva. Consciousness is free and unconditioned by Mind, Shakti’s creation.
Therefore, the fundamental identity is not just beyond the microcosmic
mind, but beyond the Macrocosmic Mind as well. The essence of a human
being, and any other being for that matter, is so sublime that its subtlety
rests beyond any vibration in this great and vast universe. Sadhana is this
process of realizing the Infinite within ones own finite being. It is the
process of discovering that there is an inner greatness and nobility to the
human being in that our relative, created being is the progeny of the Infinite
while our transcendental essence is the Infinite itself.
Shakti is a spectrum of energetic wave-lengths. This expressed
energy is divided into 3 categories. The finest wave-lengths are subtle
qualifications of Shiva. This is subtle energy. Dynamic energy is active and
119in transformation. Static energy is more inert, stationary and dense. The
Mahat, Aham, and chitta are a continuum in this spectrum of energy as
well. In other words, the Aham is a refinement of chitta and Mahat a
refinement of Aham. Mind evolves from the external to the internal kosas,
from the objective to the subjective. Conceptual forms in the chitta are
dominated by the static force of Shakti, the intelligence of the Aham by the
mutative force, and the intuition of the Mahat by the subtle. Spiritual
practice is the conversion of the static concepts of the lower mind into the
dynamic intelligence of the Aham and further converting this intelligence
into a purer, intuitive form of cognition in the Mahat. Corresponding with
this subtle refinement of cognition is a transformation of the affective
qualities. The egocentric, self-preservation qualities are enlightened by
expansive, soulful qualities that lead the heart toward its liberation from all
narrow sentiments. The practice of sadhana must begin, therefore, with the
shift of cognitive and affective focus to the higher, newly awakened or
dormant faculties of one’s being.
With the initiation into Tantric meditation, the practitioner is directed
by a process that enables them to direct their mental concentration in the
higher centers (vortexes) of mind. Accompanied by this focus of the mind
on a specific vortex, the initiate is given a certain mantra with instructions
on how to repeat it internally and how to think or ideate on this sound.
The mantra is a composition of causal sounds emanating from the
Macrocosmic Mind. By repeating the mantra during meditation the mind is
heightened above the phenomenal and personal levels of consciousness
(the lower kosas) and begins to resonate with the kosas closer to the
Macrocosmic Mind. Also it carries a certain ideational quality that signifies
that the microcosm is thinking of its essence; for example, "I am Brahma, or
I am That." Ideational refers to the mindful practice of maintaining a
spiritual idea constantly in mind. The repetition of the mantra with its
transformative idea and causal vibration vibrates the objective chitta
portion of mind, thus transforming and refining its essence. Instead of
vibrating the chitta with the body and the senses with the enjoyment of the
external world, the chitta is internally focused on an infinitesimal point
during meditation. Here one ideates on Shiva with a mantra. Recall once
more that the only difference between the micro and Macrocosmic minds is
the objective chitta. If the mind’s concentration is freed from externalities,
one feels identical to Shiva within. Sadhana is when the microcosm
attempts to make its personal ideation vibrate in harmony with the I-
Witness. One tries to remember the I-Witness always in the present
moment, the “eternal now.” The repetition of mantra facilitates this
process by pulverizing the gross objects in the chitta (baser samskaras and
vrttis) with a higher vibrational frequency. Instead of thinking “I am
useless” or “I am confused” or “I am so great,” as in mundane mental
activity, the sadhaka ideates on Shiva with optimism and clarity with the
ideation of “I am That,” “I am the Witness,” and begins to feel that the I-
120Witness is always present and guiding its dear microcosm toward ananda,
eternal bliss.
A mantra is not an arbitrary collection of sounds, nor does it just
signify a hopeful idea without a spiritually scientific purpose. It is a causal
sound tailored to the mental vibration of the initiate. There are therefore
different mantras for different mental vibrations with their accompanying
differences in personality traits, emotional and cognitive tendencies, etc.
The teacher must therefore be able to feel the mind of the initiate to
determine what mantra is appropriate for him/her or follow strictly a system
given by a great preceptor. There are many public or popular mantras that
are commonly chanted or meditated upon by many. These may elevate the
mind to some extent, but a mantra learned from a qualified teacher has a
vibrational quality specifically related and tailored to the mental qualities of
the aspirant, and therefore has more of a profound effect on the
transformation of mind.
An old Indian maxim states that "Brahma alone is the Guru." A
qualified teacher must therefore have traversed the relative microcosmic
planes of being and have united his/her mind with Brahma. Only in this
state of union is the knowledge and ability to teach meditation properly
acquired.
Tantric meditation is the vigorous conversion of physical energy into
psychic energy and psychic energy further into spiritual cognition. In this
process the objective chitta is pulverized into progressively finer
expressions, enabling more Aham and Mahat, or intellect and intuition,
respectively, to express themselves. In this process, the lower vrttis and
mental functioning on their respective cognitive planes (kosas) are
converted into higher modes of expressions. Recall the 3 laws of psycho-
spiritual development outlined in the Anahata chapter: recapitulation,
transformation and integration. There are higher modes of expression have
their roots in more basic vrttis. Before love there was blind attachment,
before conscious expansion there was ambition. Before existential
preoccupation was primal fear. All that is needed is the transformation of
energy through spiritual ideation to manifest and integrate the higher
faculties into the personality. By continually vibrating the chitta with
spiritual ideations via sadhana, the psychic energy is consciously redirected
into higher recapitulations. The lower mind is thus gradually transformed
into the higher recapitulated expressions of the higher vrttis. These subtler
expressions can be integrated into one's spiritual being much more
harmoniously than the lower vrttis. Here we see how a sadhaka must have
the vibrational and ideational force to garner these lower propensities with
ideational insight. The mind and all of its vrttis must be traversed through
sadhana.
The process of vibrating the chitta and infusing it with subtler
vibrations that transmute lower vrttis into higher ones is brought about by
very specific concentration techniques. As mentioned earlier, the initiate is
121instructed as to how to withdraw the mind from the senses and physical
body and concentrate it at one of the higher vortexes. The fact that the
mind is concentrated at a higher vortexes causes the prana or psychic
energy to flow upward, thus ascending from its habitual haunts in the lower
vortexes. This process alone causes a shift in the way the mental energy
flows and thereby fosters the unfolding of higher vrttis in that the mental
energy is now moving where it previously wasn't. In addition the initiate is
repeating the pulsative rhythm of the causal sound of a mantra with every
breath. Recall that the root of all of the vrttis is sound vibration. A mantra
has the capacity to harmonize with and transmute the collective sonar
vibration of the mind and its vrttis. The mantra is like a conductor who
understands the qualities of each instrument (vrtti) in an orchestra (the
mind) and knows how to guide it into harmony. Mantra literally means that
which liberates the mind. The mantra carries a spiritual force that helps the
mind focus on the essence of one's I-feeling. A mantra occupies the chitta
and helps to keep it one-pointed and steady like a candle flame. When the
chitta becomes like a small point, then it takes on no more forms nor
impressions from the Sensory Mind. The mind is then free to explore
internal, mental space of pure Consciousness. The spiritual ideation of the
mantra always serves as a reference to the true Witness behind all mental
phenomena. Vibrating the objective mind with the internal repetition of the
mantra instills an ideation in which the becomes so light and pure. In this
lightness one feels the awareness of the Infinite One gazing upon the mind
who repeats the ideation “I am That.” This is the perfection of mantra. The
vibrations of the objective mind are entrained with the thought of the
Supreme Subjectivity. The signifier, the mantra, corresponds ideationally
with the signified, the Supreme Subjectivity.
The level of ideational frequency in the mantra corresponds with the
minds essential intuitive abilities at the vortex where one is concentrating
or meditating. For example, to truly meditate on Shiva the mind must be
concentrated above the Anahata Vortex. The following diagram gives an
example of an initiate whose mind is bound by complexes in the Manipura
Vortex. All of the arrows point outwardly. His mental energy is dissipated
through the vrttis. He has shame, slander, sadism, hatred, and fear as
predominant tendencies in the Manipura, as well as anxiety, vanity,
selfishness, and duplicity in the Anahata. These tendencies are signified by
the arrows. The arrows are the flow of psychic energy being dissipated in
the expression of these lower vrttis. The second diagram signifies the
change in flow of prana via the vrttis while the mind is meditating or after
having undergone a transformation due to the meditation. Of course, the
practice is to bring about an overall evolutionary change in the mind
structure and not just a temporary change while one is meditating. Note
how the arrows flowing outward in the first diagram are now flowing inward
in the second. The concentration in the Ajina Vortex has shifted the
expression of vrttis from lower to higher expressions. Also, this heightened
122energy has found new, positive outlets in the form of hope, expansion of
mind, and conscience in the Anahata, putting an idea into practice and
devotion at the Vishuddha, and the cultivation of spiritual knowledge at the
Ajina. This growth process indeed occurs in healthy minds without
meditation as it is the essential dharma of human beings. However, the
conscious redirection of energy through sincere and dedicated spiritual
practice expedites this evolutionary process. A spiritual practitioner must
therefore be strong, vigorous and fearless in order to mentally digest these
changes.
The desire for psychic and spiritual liberation can only come about
once the mind has reached the Anahata level of thought feeling, and
activity. Here one has an intimation that there is a higher spiritual order in
the universe even though one may still be bound to the lower realms and
their expressions. The beginning aspirant must therefore have tremendous
determination to surmount the binding influences of the lower vrttis. Along
with this determination must be the cultivation of mental vigor and
discipline in order to have the awareness and vitality to convert lower
psychic expressions into more refined ones. In Tantra this stage is termed
the Warrior stage of sadhana. Warrior signifies energy and the need to
cultivate it willfully. In this stage it is necessary to meditate regularly, study
philosophy, engage in positive activity or service, and learn from those who
are more spiritually advanced. All energy must be channelized into
following the inspiration and guidance of the conscience. This takes
tremendous effort as one is not yet fully established in their overall
concentration on the spiritual ideal. In order to surmount the duplicity
between the desires and conditioning of the lower ego and the intuitions of
the conscience, all efforts must go into bringing about this congruence
between the subjective ideal and the objectively real. Or in other words,
the thought feeling and action must become in accord with dharmic
conscience. Before this stage all of one's struggles were based on securing
the phenomenal identity of the ego. One sought to establish oneself
according to or against some sort of outer, social reality. The mind was
sharply split into a duality between self and other, between self and world,
between impulse and conscience, and between conditioning and self-
cultivation. Because all of the psychic energy is in the ego, the "doer-I", it is
necessary for spiritual practice at this stage to be rooted in the ego.
Instead of the ego being a self-encapsulated end in itself, it is at this stage
attempting to align itself with the Mahat, the inner conscience. Still, it is
the medium of action but it is moving toward that which can guide and
control it. In other words, the Warrior stage of sadhana is the attempt for
the objective dominated ego to transform the crude chitta in order to align
itself with the subjective conscience of the Mahat. The second diagram
shows how the expression of the lower vrttis change with sadhana.
123124125126There are many sub-stages in spiritual development. Spiritual life
follows a Hegelian of dialectic in that the developing mind is always
changing in response to new realities and their corresponding conflicts.
127Nothing in this relative world is permanent. Perhaps what we hold as a
great truth today may become something very commonplace or even false
tomorrow. Greater realizations lead to more subtle conflicts that continually
propel one to find continually more subtle resolutions. An aspirant must
accept this continuous cycle of clash and cohesion until one understands
the impermanence of the mind. What we find as true at one stage may
undergo changes later. A truth may evolve and undergo changes, thus
requiring us to once again modify our concepts.
However, there comes a stage in spiritual life when one becomes
established in one's conscience. Here the dualities between inner and
outer, and impulse and conscience are more resolved. One has acquired
the strength, stamina and wisdom to continually follow one's inner ideal.
Previously, in the Warrior stage, the conception of the Supreme Conscious
was by necessity dualistic; god was seen as an outside force that controls
and guides a universe that I am separated from. One worships heroes like
Krishna or Moses. In the second, Devotional stage, one becomes so
completely ensconced in the Mahat that the life of the dualistic ego has
been incorporated into the creative forces of the universe. One gradually
becomes very close to the Macrocosmic Mind of Brahma and willful effort
loses its necessity. One begins to flow with dharma, the moral order of the
universe.
Human life reaches its apex at this stage. All of the evolutionary
forces propelling one along the evolutionary path have flourished into a
united life with Spirit. Virtue, justice, wisdom and goodness pour forth
naturally and effortlessly from ones being. It is not the case that the
personal relative identity is entirely dissolved, but rather that the
microcosmic ego exists in harmony with the Macrocosm. The personality is
an extension, a vehicle and mechanism for Brahma. In other words, Mahat
is the faculty that guides the mind while Aham and chitta are the passive
recipients to its inspiration. What need of there is effort at this stage?
Does one still have to cling to the battered boat that took one across the
turbulent sea of samskara? Brahma is one's very own and dear essence
while the life of the seeking ego has become a distant memory. One has
arrived at the destination. All one desires is to be in union with Brahma. As
the Upanishad exclaims, "one must become altogether lost in Brahma, as
an arrow in its target."
There is still the existence of the microcosm in the Warrior stage. The
chitta, Aham and Mahat of the microcosm resonate with and are
harmonized with the chitta, Aham, and Mahat of the Macrocosmic Mind.
This is the stage of liberation, or Mukti. It is the stage of the savikalpa
samadhis, where the microcosmic mind may suspend its separateness in
the Macrocosmic Mind for a determined period of time. The mind at this
stage may still hold its personal samskaras or be bound to subtle
Macrocosmic samskaras (the propensities of the Vishuddha and Ajina
Vortexs). It is these samskaras that determine the duration of the union
128with Brahma in samadhi. The rise of vibrations in the chitta due to these
subtle samskaras perpetuate the existence of the microcosm. Recall the
descriptions of the Vishuddha, Ajina, and Sahasrara Vortexs in chapter 2. In
these stages of evolution the microcosm is closely bound to the
macrocosm. If such a being chooses, they may continue to exist in order to
help other beings find liberation. This determination creates a samskara for
them so that their mind may continue to have a momentum of continued
existence in harmony with the Macrocosmic Mind.
However, recall that at the Sahasrara it is possible for the mind to
entirely dissolve in Shiva. Instead of the chitta, Aham and Mahat resonating
with the Macrocosm, they become entirely dissolved in the essential being
of Shiva in the Shaeva stage. This is the stage of nirvikalpa samadhi, the
samadhi of indeterminate absorption in Shiva. When nirvikalpa samadhi is
of a permanent nature, it is termed emancipation, or Moksha.
The dissolution of mind corresponds exactly with the waning of the
binding influence of Shakti over Shiva. Shakti’s sentient, mutative, and
static forces upheld the existences of the Mahat, Aham, and chitta,
respectively. Now that mind is entirely dissolved in Consciousness, the
activity of Shakti can no longer bind that particular mind, for there is no
longer the existence of mind. The universe and creation no longer exist for
that emancipated mind; there is only the oneness of the infinite and eternal
Brahma.
In order to complete the cycle of creation, one must see the absolute
oneness of Brahma, that even this physical creation is a manifestation of
Spirit. Without this understanding we have not fulfilled our purpose in this
creation. Has the Macrocosm created all of this only to show its essential
nothingness, without purpose or reason? The illusionist, the spiritual nihilist,
closes his eyes all through the day only waiting for the sleep of night. It is
the same with all that resist Oneness. They seek an escape from how things
really are and deny the essential spirituality of creation and fail to see that
our being in this world is to give a name to the nameless, an expression of
the inexpressible. As long as one resists the spiritual nature of creation
there is no release from it. As Vivekananda once stated, we must leave our
mark on this world before we go. True, all is intransient, vaporous, and
incessantly passing away from us. But within this hazy mist is a definite
theme and purpose for its every particle.
Mukti, or liberation of the mind, is when the memories of one's existence
are no longer exclusively related to the experiences of the present body.
The notion of life begins to extend into the life of the universe. The
spiritually-oriented mind goes beyond the personal memories, the
memories of ones lineage and culture, and begins to live within the
memories of the human race. Slowly humanity is understood as the
personal life is more deeply understood. All memories of your incarnation
begin to merge into the eternal presence. What happened 30 years ago
may begin to seem like it was yesterday. A memory of my childhood home
129makes me open my eyes from meditation to see if I really am there. Not
having an absolute definition of yourself is no longer a problem. Who is
really living this life anyway? There is but one life and it is a good life. The
more we merge our separateness in understanding and compassion, the
more happy, the more liberated we are.
For this reason the knowers of the I-Witness live with an ever-new
understanding of their place in the universe and can offer some real good
to humanity through their variegated examples. Liberation is a long process
that begins even before the awakening of the kundalini. The Infinite has
always been calling is back to the cosmic nucleus of Hunab Ku; ever since
we were amoebas. A human becomes conscious of this never-ending
process of the liberation of the mind from the finite world with the
awakening of the kundalini. This awakening and invigoration of the psycho-
biological centers in the spinal column induce a recapitulation of
Macrocosmic, planetary evolution within one's personal being. One begins
to merge one's personal samskaras or memories with the Macrocosmic
mind that sustains the Gia, our Earth Mother. One goes deeper into the life
of the planet, into the life of the universe. The effort to liberate the mind
via kundalini only ends when a life, a microcosmic evolution, is completely
full and ripe. All things are made good within. Only when one has lived fully
according to their conscience and has expressed a deep, spiritual intention
toward life is one capable of attaining Moksha Here, even these good
memories of this microcosmic existence are wiped clean for ever as the
mind itself has disintegrated in the supreme Shiva. If one desires this
absolute union with the godhead, then one should only live the best life
possible, a life full truth and union with the Supreme Consciousness and the
expressed universe. The fundamental purpose of life always leads one first
to liberation and later emancipation.
Microcosms are liberated one at a time. Because of this, the universe
is eternal. The cycle of creation, Brahma Chakra, is continuous. Creation is
pouring forth from the cosmic nucleus while at the same time creation is
returning into union with the cosmic nucleus. While there are beings
evolving toward emancipation, there is at the same time the generation of
eternally new creation as the eternally active Shakti transforms the infinite
Shiva. Due to this, creation is endless and eternal. Brahma Chakra, the
Wheel of Creation, only comes to an end with the microcosm, never for the
Macrocosm. Fragments of the Macrocosm (microcosms) are liberated, but
never the Macrocosm as a whole. The Macrocosmic Mind has endless
samskaras and is eternally Generator, Operator, and Destroyer.
In Brahma, the godhead, is the eternal emancipation, or Moksha. In
this stage the kundaliini, which is the manifestation of Shakti within the
microcosm, has been elevated to the Sahasrara, the abode of Shiva. Shakti
again takes its place beside Shiva in the state of eternal and infinite
equipoise. Birth, death, creation and evolution are non-existent and illusory
for the emancipated. There exists only pure Consciousness without an
130object. Shiva is aware only of itself, absorbed eternally in its blissful
essence.

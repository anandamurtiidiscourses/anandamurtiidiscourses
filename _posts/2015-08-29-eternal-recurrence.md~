title: The Eternal Recurrence
tags: [Spiritual Tantra]

Nietzche spoke of a rather odd phenomenon that he called the "Eternal Recurrence."  According to this theory the reality that we construct by our own free will repeats itself eternally.  He was deeply immersed in Buddhist literature as a Sanskrit philologist and this idea seems to be a very original and subjective interpretation of the archetypal idea of reincarnation.  When I was 22 my mentor Chidghananda spoke to me of my supposed past lives.  He only did this because I playfully tricked him into it.  However, what he told me was very very serious and took away all sensational mystique of this phenomenon.  He only told me what I already knew, really.  He never exceeded that, but only clarified what were for me new revelations about my inner life.  I had two loving grandfathers in this earthly life, and Chidghananda beamed with the love of a hundred noble grandfathers.    "Baba was Baba," he told me.  He was an infinite mystery that he never tried to capture in any final, dogmatic conception.  There were also some other spiritual grandfathers.  Some went on into "moksha" at death (emancipation with no re-birth), but many took "mukti" (liberation from reincarnation but oneness with the eternal activity of the Cosmic Mind of Brahma.)  Even the ones that went into moksha left some important gifts before their absolute departure into moksha, which is quite similar to the idea of Nirvana.  They were a non-local, decentralized force for their departed guru and continue to pass on that sublime shakti within the collective mind of the disciples from now into the future.  Chidghananda never died for me.  When he left his physical body I felt him near me whenever I thought of him.  He showed me the way to the guru in life and he only continues to do so in death.  Our Dead Dada's Society is everywhere and nowhere; it is super-personal, decentralized, cosmicly free and wild.

Chidghananda told me that my work was done, and that I only had to a little more of a martial form of meditation or sadhana.  Other than that, I had no other duties.  Sure, he told me I could raise money for service projects or help out in any other way if possible, but my only real duty was to fulfill my spiritual duty with this sadhana.  After so many years of trying to understand this, I came to the conclusion that those days were but an experience of liberation from past samskaras (reactions to previous actions).  I was free to create new actions in the present.  This liberation has more to do with the realization of the inner "I" rather than the outer "I am" of the ego or personality.  The personality may still exist but it has no past nor pending desires.  Memories of life begin to be whitened, purified and unified in the eternal present.  Yet Chidghananda further told me that I would pass through inconceivable sufferings but that I would never fall because the guru would guide even this.  Sure enough, there has been nothing but conflict and resolution, and also a little revolution.  The dice of the gods are loaded.  No actions are original.  Free will only exists in theory.  When the past ceases to exist then the ego is a mirage and the question of "free will" becomes silly and infantile.  Only Brahma is real, yet one must continue to choose and act in the human world while paying the eternal sacrament of sacrificing the fruits of "independent" action into the eternal fire of Brahma.  Hence, the Cosmic Show, the Headkick Headtrick Tantra as an eternal recurrence.

While I am hesitant to speak of past lives of future lives, I do think it is important to recognize the idea of "reincarnation" if we know that it really effects us in an experiential, phenomenal manner.  I think it is more important to see repeating cycles within ones present incarnation rather than try to see them in previous ones.  Nature is intelligent enough to show one's samskaras if one develops a little intuition.  Life itself teaches all of the patterns of conditioning, both inherited and aquired, by always bringing us back to where our issues lie.

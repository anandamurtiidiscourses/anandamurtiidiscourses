The other day a woman who helps us here in our gardens was returning home to the local village. On the way home she was approaching a lake which is just about 1/2 km from here. She heard a muffled gunshot, as if fired from close range. She thought somebody must be sacrificing a cow or goat that was injured or ill by the lake. A moment later she sees a figure of a man in a plaid shirt running away from the lake and into the bare desert. He promptly disappears and it made her doubt if there really was a figure. However, she was certain there was and knew it wasn’t her imagination. She checked to see if he left any tracks in the sand but she didn’t see any.

As she got even closer to the lake she saw that there were police vehicles there. She saw them removing the body of a man with the same plaid shirt as the figure who was running away from the lake. Unfortunately, our once quiet little valley has turned into Buchenvald and this happens all of the time. We have an embarrassing gas problem around here, you know, the Haliburton kind. Do the narcos work for them? Hopefully the world is tuned into this; we are sitting ducks.

In the meanwhile I ponder what it is she saw. Was it a premonition like a pre-cognitive event that occurs before something that really overwhelms the mind? For example, many mothers will have this type of pre-cognition at the same time their children suffer an accident far away. Or was it the perception of the murdered man’s spirit escaping the scene of a terrible death?  Or is this situation making us all delirious?  Anybody who knows me knows that I take these weird phenomenon very seriously and I always try to see it from all angles. I lean more toward my first idea of a pre-cognitive event but I am open to suggestions.

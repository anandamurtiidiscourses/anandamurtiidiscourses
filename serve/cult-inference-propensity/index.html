    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>The subject of today’s discourse is “Cult, Inference and Propensity.” The path that leads or goads the aspirant unto Parama Puruśa is “cult” in the true spirit of the term. Where the goal is something finite, where the pabulum is something limited, the path and the movement cannot be treated as cult.</p>

<p>Spiritual practice is based on cult: adherence to the doctrine of cult is started and practised in the primordial phase by the doer “I” of all living beings. The doer “I” keeps on thinking, “I am working, I am eating, I am seeing, I do not know anything, I know so many things.”</p>

<p>In living beings other than humans, the doer “I” is not properly expressed, and that is why they cannot establish their individual identity or do spiritual practice. In certain animals like dogs and monkeys, the doer “I” is a bit more expressed or developed than in other creatures. That is why in the future they may also be in a position to do this practice .</p>

<p>You should also remember that this doer “I” performs spiritual practice with the help of vital energy, not with the help of positive or negative microvita. In fact, the vital energy accelerates the speed of spiritual progress. Microvita, positive or negative, help the aspirant in his or her movement, but the aspirant cannot utilize the microvita.</p>

<p>When the doer “I” of the aspirant is goaded towards the Supreme Entity, it uses the vital energy acquired through different quinquelemental factors, passing through different planes of inferences, and through different propensities of the human mind, without suppressing those propensities of the mind. The question of suppression, repression and oppression does not arise in the realm of spiritual cult. You are simply to maintain equilibrium and equipoise – that is, you are to move maintaining proper parallelism with the fundamental propensities of the human mind. So spiritual practice is performed by the doer “I” with the help of energy, of so many energies which are converted into vital energy when they pass through the different planes of inferences.</p>

<p>It is not proper to think that this movement, this spiritual advancement, is something purely of individual character. No entity in this universe exists individually. Ours is a universal family. Each and every entity – living and non-living, moving and non-moving – helps others in maintaining not only their equilibrium, but also the equipoise of the entire universe, not only of this small planet Earth. We are to move together with all.</p>

<p>Even if an ant dies a premature death, it is bound to jeopardize the balance of the entire universe. Even if a 110 year old widow thinks that her life has no existential value on this planet, that she is a mere burden to society, it is a defective idea. No – even the life of such an old widow contributes to maintaining the balance of the universe. If such an old person dies prematurely, it is bound to jeopardize the balance of the universal society.</p>

<p>If people think that they will make steady progress in the spiritual sphere even if the society goes to the dogs, they are mistaken. You who are genuine spiritualists should practise spiritual cult thinking that by doing so you will become effective in maintaining the universal balance. You must think, “I will personally move towards the supreme desideratum, and at the same time I will try to assist those who are suffering from despair, those steeped in blind superstition and those wallowing in poverty.” Our family is universal, our abode is also universal.</p>

<p>Hararme pitá gaorii mátá
Svadesha bhuvanatrayam.</p>

<p>“The Universal Father, Shiva, is our Father. The Universal Mother, Gaorii, is our Mother. She is the causal matrix. And this universe is our homeland.”</p>

<p>This spiritual cult is the only cult; others are not cult, they are mere dogma. If the cult is proper – if it is cult in the true spirit of the term – it creates a sort of subtlety in one’s mental flow. Under such circumstances, we receive necessary help from positive microvita. This help that we receive by dint of our spiritual practices is composed of eight occult powers. These powers are known as “occult” because they are acquired through cult. But while acquiring these occult or so-called “miraculous” powers, we cannot do anything without the help of positive microvita. These occult powers are ańimá, laghimá, mahimá, iishitva, vashvitva, prakámya, prápti and antaryámitva. The entity who is endowed with all of them is known as “Iishvara”.</p>

<p>Ańimá means “converting one’s psychic existence into a small point and then transforming it into a minimum entity.” One may understand anything by entering into each and every physical particle and becoming one with the different waves of expression and emanation, by dancing with the wavelengths of objects or ideas. Unless and until one’s very psychic existence is converted into a point, one cannot move or dance according to the wavelengths of objects or ideas. This occult power acquired through positive microvita is called “ańimá”.</p>

<p>Laghimá makes the mind light, free from the bondages of so many liabilities. This carefree mind, freed from the fetters of materialistic bondages, can understand and think properly. So by dint of this occult power, one may understand any idea, subtle or crude, in the abstract realm.</p>

<p>Unless you understand how much pain and sorrow is accumulated in others’ minds, how many tears well up in their eyes, you cannot alleviate their sorrows and sufferings. Through laghimá, you can acquire this particular power to study others’ minds.</p>

<p>The third one is mahimá or expansion of mind. With the help of positive microvita, mind can be expanded. The radius of the mind may cover the entire universe, and we may have ideas about different subjects even without reading books and literature. And in this way, too, we may feel our oneness with the varied entities of this universe – unity in variety, unity in diversity. By associating our benevolent thoughts with each and every entity, we will contribute to universal progress and prosperity.</p>

<p>Iishitva enables the spiritual aspirant to guide other minds who suffer from different psychic ailments. So many people in this world are crying in pain and agony. So many miseries and afflictions have paralysed human beings physically and mentally. In leading this afflicted humanity to their physical progress and psychic well-being, this occult power of iishitva will help you tremendously. It can be achieved through positive microvita which is in turn acquired through the regular practice of cult. By sitting idle and crying constantly one cannot achieve this.</p>

<p>Vashvitva helps a person to bring defective ideas, or people goaded by defective ideas, unto the path of supreme greatness. If people are to be guided towards their definite progress, they will first have to be brought under one’s control. If such people work haphazardly and do not follow the right path, they cannot be expected to reach the state of welfare. So, if you really want to help people, you will have to bring them under control and then direct them along the right path to their goal. This occult power can be achieved through positive microvita.</p>

<p>Prakámya or the right mode of thinking aimed at promoting universal welfare, brings light to the entire universe. Through this occult power, spiritual aspirants acquire what is needed to serve the entire world.</p>

<p>Prápti means helping oneself and helping the souls of so many people to acquire and be benefited by the grace of the supreme.</p>

<p>And the eighth one is antaryámitva – to be able to enter within the ectoplasmic or endoplasmic structures of others, and thereby to know the pains and pleasures, the hopes, aspirations and longings of others to guide them properly. It is somewhat like the transmigration of souls. Regarding this eighth occult power, spiritual cult alone will not suffice – it requires the special grace of Parama Puruśa.</p>

<p>There is yet another occult power – the power of omniscience, to be all-knowing. This power of omniscience cannot be achieved only through the practice of cult, nor with the help of positive microvita – one must reach the height of devotion and achieve the grace of the supreme. Otherwise, even if people dash their heads against a wall, they still cannot acquire omniscience with the help of positive microvita.</p>

<p>And above all occult powers is the supreme knowledge – ensconcement in Parama Puruśa. This is not only a sort of omniscience, rather it elevates the aspirant to be one with the supreme cognitive faculty. Of course, those who are already endowed with devotion will automatically acquire this power.</p>

<p>Bhaktih bhagavato sevá, bhaktih prema svarúpińii,
Bhaktiránanda rúpáca, bhaktih bhaktasya jiivanam.</p>

<p>“Devotion means service unto the Lord. Devotion is of the nature of selfless love. Devotion is bliss incarnate. Devotion is the very life of the devotee.”</p>

<p>Devotion means working in the service of the Supreme according to His satisfaction. Without devotion, one’s mind cannot rise beyond the pituitary gland – if one wants to take the mind beyond that, one needs devotion. So the supreme spiritual progress of microcosms is never possible without devotion.</p>

<p>If you have devotion, you can call Parama Puruśa to you; He will certainly come to you, rather He must come to you. For this, you may or may not have anything else, but if you have devotion, you have everything. By dint of that, one attains Parama Puruśa, one becomes identified with Him. This is the summum bonum of human life.</p>

<p>Regarding prema or selfless love, it is said:</p>

<p>Samyauṋmasrńito shánto mamatvátishayáunkitah;
Bháva sá eva sándrátmá budhaeh prema nigadyate.</p>

<p>“The attitude which makes the mind smooth and placid, and radiant with the deepest love for the Lord, is called “bháva”. Wise people call this “prema” or “divine love”.</p>

<p>Prema is the attraction for Parama Puruśa overcoming the attraction for all other finite objects. Those who are endowed with such divine love are bound to receive the grace of Parama Puruśa – they need not worry about it. If they practise the spiritual cult regularly, positive microvita are sure to help them. Those who arouse devotion through action and knowledge are certain to attain the grace of Parama Puruśa. This grace need not be huge in quantity – even a wee bit of it will be enough.</p>

<p>Mahatkrpayaeva bhagavatkrpáleshádvá.</p>

<p>“One can attain the supreme stance by the blessings of the exalted ones, as well as a wee bit of Macrocosmic grace.”</p>

<p>Only such people endowed with the grace of the supreme are in the best position to render maximum service to this universe.</p>

<p>While practising spiritual cult, it should be remembered that spiritual aspirants must not practise in order to acquire these occult powers. The goal of spiritual practice is to realize the Supreme Entity. To search for any other thing is wrong. Occult powers are just like the dust on the roadside. The attraction for Parama Puruśa is the most valuable object – all else is only the dust of the earth.</p>

<p>Hence the spiritual aspirant must not run after these inconsequential occult powers, although while prasticing spiritual cult they may develop. You must not forget that all your achievements must maintain adjustment with the main propensities of the mind, and in the process of adjustment, all these eight types of occult powers present themselves to the spiritual aspirant.</p>

<p>Sádhaná starts in the plane of physicality and moves towards the physico-psychic plane. This first phase of sádhaná is performed by the “doer I”. Then from the physico-psychic plane to the pure psychic plane, and from the pure psychic plane to the psycho-spiritual plane – this portion of sádhaná is done by the “knower I”.</p>

<p>In the final stage of sádhaná, the pure spiritual phase, none of these can help the spiritual aspirant; even positive and negative microvita cannot function above the psycho-spiritual level, beyond the pituitary gland. No vibration is of any help. In such circumstances, finally you will have to depend on the grace of the supreme and nothing else. One is obliged to declare, Brahmakrpáhi kevalam, that is, the grace of Parama Puruśa is everything.</p>

<p>Everything in this universe is created, everything survives and everything ultimately dissolves in and through Him. Regarding this Supreme Entity, the scriptures say,</p>

<p>Yato vishvaḿ samudhútaḿ
Yena játaiṋca tiśthati;
Yasmin sarváni liiyanta
Jineyam tadbrama lakśanach.</p>

<p>“Out of the grace of the supreme, the universe has emerged; due to His grace, the universe preserves its existence; and because of His grace, everything will finally dissolve in Him.”</p>

<p>So the final word in the realm of spirituality is the supreme grace of Parama Puruśa. Intelligent people will understand this supreme truth and move accordingly. It is true not only in the physical level, nor in the physico-psychic level, nor in the psychic, nor in the psycho-spiritual level, but in all levels.</p>

<p>Finally, whatever you say or think, everything is finally embedded in the grace of Parama Puruśa. The sooner this fundamental truth is realized, the better it will be for all.</p>

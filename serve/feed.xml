    &lt;p&gt;Everything we experience in human life is an expression of the Macrocosm. Whether one calls the Macrocosm “Brahma”, or “Tao”, or a “Unified Quantum Field”, it is the source and ground of our physical, mental and spiritual being. The source of the Macrocosm is purely spiritual, It is pure Consciousness; the silent I-Witness behind the active, oscillating mind. When you are quiet, this infinity is yours. The mental part of the macrocosm only faintly manifests in human intelligence. When humans become more intelligent they will have then merged a little deeper into the mental and spiritual aspects of the Macrocosm. Only the outer reflection of this pure and unified web of being is material. It is material and separate only in our minds, however. One can have a spiritual experience of the physical world of matter and form and still not be convinced of the absoluteness of matter. Form is but a manifestation of spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything and everyone has deep, reserve parts of their being that are latent and only waiting to manifest when the external ego is a little more mature and calm. A person who has lived away from civilization for many years returns to see the world of form and matter. His physical world had become the mountain, river, sky, and body. They all secretly speak of spirit, however. He remembers the old forms of cars and malls and wars and all of the dread of material existence. These forms only seem a little more dead now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one really believes in the reality of these things then the mind actually becomes like those things. Mind is a living entity that vibrates and takes on the form of material objects. “As you think, so you become.” If you believe that “objects” are a part of the unified web of the Macrocosm, then matter is a delight. Your being may flow into the being of all at the delight of a flower or taste of a berry. Things vibrate and are sustained and invigorated by an invisible, vibrant energy that pervades even empty space. If objects are something to purchase, posses, and fill inner voids, then the objective material world is quite simply an existential hell of separation from natural truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If people are a manifestation of spirit, then “brother” and “sister” are everywhere. If people are objects instead of Subjects, then we have separation, continual strife and chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Places and spaces, physical, mental, and spiritual- all vibrate with the tone of spirit behind them. Energy and ideas congeal into things. A sensitive person will easily detect an unhappy house or an unhappy city. There is an aura of discomfort vibrating around these places. The mental energy that created and inhabits these spaces is desperate, compulsive, separate and fearful. Humanity’s unconscious being is simply revealed in our social and personal habitations. My teacher Chidghananda couldn’t stand entering cities. He always saw deep into the being of others and knew even their inmost thoughts. When he entered the city he was bombarded by so many unseen thoughts and energies that inhabit those spaces. Little was hidden from him. It is the same phenomenon with cyber spaces. To enter the internet, most especially social media, is but to enter into all of the unseen mental desires and needs that drive humans to project themselves into mental-social spaces. People also project their unseen needs into these spaces and they in fact vibrate and live there. Some spaces are vibrant while some are really dead and only try to devitalize the mind with cyber reflections of what was already a mundane, unnatural, and uncreative mental projection to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Include file ‘gallery images=images caption=”” cols=3’ contains invalid characters or sequences&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spiritual heart is the Anahata Vortex. Anahata means “not holding.”
It is the intuitive level of mind that begins to understand that there is an
infinite vastness and dignity inside itself and can begin to let go of blind
attachments caused by an underlying sense of fear and insecurity.
The intuitive mind of Anahata vibrates in tune with the Aerial Factor, a
very fine form of matter or prana that manifests its intentions toward form,
yet being beyond form itself. When completely purified this prana no
longer needs to vibrate with the vrttis or vortexes of the mind. The breath
stops completely. One is empty of form, but full of bliss. One hears the
inner logos of Shiva, all the sounds that make up Om, and sees how fine
vibrations of prana manifest the entire material universe. These rhythmic
vibrations or “strings” or pulses of prana stem from the “root” sounds of the
Causal Mind, the logos of Shiva. One day the human genius will be able
to map and even quantify these fine vibrations that make up the so-called
“quantum void.” Then, human beings will begin to understand the secrets
of the dimensions between mind and matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until this placation of the spiritual heart, the vrttis of the Anahata will
continue to guide and develop our awareness toward this understanding.
These fine sounds of the vrttis will vibrate the mind and attempt to
regulate the endocrine and nervous systems so that they can develop
higher functions. The 3rd and 4th vortexes of the Anahata Vortex are
controlled by the sounds “ga” and “gha.” “Ga” manifests a tendency
towards self-expansion and development of latent qualities, and “gha”
manifests a tendency toward deep, human affection, or love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the manifestation of the vrtti of expansion, the mind’s
“endeavor” is really expansion of the ego based on conquests of physical
space and material or acquisitions psychic meaning for the separate,
fearful, ego-dominated personality. This is the world of action and reaction.
The separate ego is always trying to find meaning and security to
compensate for its isolation and fear. One tries to fit into the social and
economic systems with ready-made patterns. These patterns most often do
not harmonize with the cosmological order and we suffer reactions
accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the vrtti of endeavor at the Anahata the latent qualities of the
Macrocosmic Mind, the repository of infinite, omniscient knowledge, can
begin to manifest themselves. New qualities, interests and subtle desires
begin to manifest in the personality. It is a psychic instinct that directs us
toward greater meaning at the intuitive level of mind. Where did your
spiritual and creative desires come from and when exactly did they start?
What hidden force directed you toward certain people, certain places,
books, or practices that opened up your inner spiritual life? At the intuitive
level of mind we begin to realize that there is an inner vastness that is
really living our lives and really knows how to do it. One only has to
convince the separate ego to go along with this flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Gha”, the vibration that regulates affection, is the counter-balance of
endeavor, or “ga.” Knowledge via expansion of the mind is useful to solve
existential problems and it is imperative that this knowledge be developed
in all spheres of existence- physical, social, psychological and spiritual.
However, no form of knowledge is complete without love, without a greater
human purpose for this knowledge. At the anahata level, reason and
affection aren’t yet separated. Head and heart are one. And it is possible
that all of the finer human qualities and intelligence may serve us not in an
accelerated collective destruction, but toward universal love and justice. It
is only when the warmth of deep human love is missing that the mind
becomes a rogue mind that constantly devours itself and others and keeps
itself forever separate from the intuitive order of existence. Spiritual
knowledge without the development of the finer, loving qualities of the
personality is an impossibility. This level of love is not yet universal
compassion because there are still finer needs of personal significance.
However, the development of these higher emotive functions eventually
lead one toward universal love or compassion, a quality of the Vishuddha
(5th) vortex, an even higher level of human consciousness. Here, one is so
close to the Atman that there remain few, if any, personal needs and one
only loves without any expectation or desire of reciprocation. When
Anahata is purified it becomes a direct conduit for the Causal Mind of
Vishuddha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Endeavor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Endeavor is the effort to unfold enfolded or dormant qualities of the
personality. We see that with the Anahata that there is the ability to think
in a very deep and meaningful way. With this sublime ability the mind can
probe into the deepest grounds of thought potential to discover and create
new modes of being for itself that further the expansion of human potential
and knowledge of existence. At the Manipura (3rd vortex) there was still the
impulsive hunger for expanding the mind in relation to its external
conceptual world. With the vrtti of endeavor the mind can expand itself not
merely by assimilating more of its outer environment, but by finding inner,
intuitive qualities that broaden and enlighten the concept of self. Endeavor
is the effort to discover who we really are on the inside. Now that there is a
greater degree of Mahat (self-reflecting awareness, “I exist”) and therefore
intuition, with a corresponding decrease in the externalized intellect, the
mind begins to question what the “I” truly is. At this stage the personality
is very well aware of the limited ego-driven tendencies and seeks to know
the reality and identity behind these limitations. And it is only when the
limited ego is frustrated with its external expansion and clearly sees its own
bondages that the desire to realize its inner and fuller potential is aroused.
Here one truly sees the life of incessant self-concern, ambition, and
attachment as the illusion of Self. With the manifestation of Mahat or “I-
feeling” and intuition one can look down upon the fray and ask “who is it
that sees all of this?” There is a calm, quiescent eye in the storm of the
self and one begins to desire what it is and how to attain it. Endeavor is
quite simply the desire for the understanding of Tao, of dharma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this movement is endeavor to realize and not realization itself.
The ego here assumes the qualities and identity necessary to live in
accordance with a deeper understanding and experience of existence. It is
not ensconsement and establishment in the intuitive life but the movement
toward that. Instead of the ego having an image of itself in accordance
with its external desires, it now manifests the qualities that help in its
psycho-spiritual orientation. Such qualities are necessarily ones that help
to understand, accept, and integrate the lower propensities into a more
refined self-concept. Such qualities are an acute awareness, non-judgment
of self and others, acceptance, compassion, moral conscience and an
adamant resolve to bring these qualities into expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While discussing this growth of self it is necessary to mention the 3 laws
that regulate the unfolding of higher propensities to incorporate and
compensate for the lower. These laws are recapitulation, transmutation,
and integration. It is clearly seen now how successive levels of
development grow through previous levels and that the vrttis at higher
vortexes are a similar though more refined expression of the lower vrttis.
The vrttis recapitulate themselves in successively higher modus operandi.
The mind isn’t entering entirely new form as it evolves to higher levels;
things are just restated in a more subtle way. For example, endeavor isn’t
impulsive like its predecessor, craving (at the Manipura), but both have to
do with mental expansion. Due to the fact that there are higher, more
conscious tendencies that correspond to more subtle levels of existence,
there is by necessity a transmutation of the energy used in the expression
of the lower as it moves toward the higher. Endeavor requires patience and
deep awareness, not forced and willful activity as in craving. Vrttis are
ingrained tendencies, mental instincts, that have evolved to serve an
evolutionary purpose and so there isn’t a rapid, immediate transition from
the old to the new. The new has to be born into being and the old will
continue to assert itself. This evolutionary shift in mental expression
therefore requires tremendous energy conversion. This process happens
unconsciously through an innate and expansive guiding faculty as well as
through the will and choice. One can decide to move along and follow one’s
inner voice that is leading the transmutation. If not, then there is always
trouble. A factor necessary for the successful transmutation of the higher
frequency of mental energy is integration. The old must be incorporated
into the new. That old expression of energy must be entirely directed into
the new faculty; otherwise the mind will be split in that there are now
opposing expressions of mind. This split may either to duplicity, a
regression to previous modes of behavior or a repression of the lower by
the higher. To use our previous example, the spiritually oriented personality
propelled by the endeavor vrtti may repress his ambitious tendencies from
his conscious awareness, but these old ambitious and willful tendencies still
have an energetic momentum to assert themselves unconsciously. He may
therefore express duplicity or hypocrisy by saying one thing and
unconsciously doing another. A similar psychological dissociation of the
lower from the higher was mentioned while discussing worry and will be
dealt with more when discussing the vrttis of vanity, selfishness, duplicity,
and argumentativeness as these tendencies reveal an incomplete
integration of lower vrttis into the self-reflective, intuitive, and
magnanimous potentialities of the Anahata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dissociation of the newly emerging tendencies from the old,
ingrained behavior patterns produces what classical psychology has termed
the shadow. The shadow doesn’t reside in one particular kosa, in other
words it is not a layer of mind. It is a defaulted mechanism of integration
from one mental-emotive level to the next. Whatever is not accepted and
integrated and therefore either repressed or suppressed is relegated into
the shadowy category of the “not me.” For example, if the mind doesn’t
have the vigor to make the jump from the Svadhistana (2 nd vortex) to the
Manipura (3rd vortex), then the entropic vrttis of the Svadhistana become
the shadow for the vigorous and ambitious mind that is trying to function at
the Manipura level. The entropy of the Svadhistana vrttis will complicate
and confound the autocratic Manipura vrttis. The externally driven
personality may suppress his/her tendencies that are associated with
insecurity and lack of confidence. In a similar manner, if the jump to the
Anahata from Manipura is not complete, as in our previous example, then
the vrttis or cluster of vrttis that constituted the former personality at the
Manipura become the shadow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affection&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The affection of one sentient being for another as expressed through
this tendency at the Anahata is not one of an intense desire to consume
and possess another solely to gratify one’s own appetites. The quality of
interpersonal dialogue at the Anahata is a mutual, inter-subjective regard.
There is a love based on the deeply human qualities of another. It is not
completely selfless, however. Here there is still a desire to hold onto the
qualities of another because of the deep meaning (artha) that is given. This
form of attachment isn’t to satiate one’s hunger for external expansion but
is a fondness for the other based on the way that others affect them in a
deep and soulful way. With affection one’s heart is touched by another. The
inner qualities of another are loved by means of the deeper qualities of the
one who loves. In this dialogue the one who is loved is regarded for who
they really are on the inside and the lover exercises and discovers more of
his/her deeply human affective capacities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human love, whether intimate and romantic, familial, or brotherly has
such a tremendous hold over us that it both liberates our hearts from self-
enclosure while at the same time holds us only to those that we personally
love. Affection must be perfectly balanced in order to bring happiness,
otherwise it breeds suffering. It brings happiness when the regard we have
for others supersedes our own selfish wants and demands and thereby
propels us beyond self-interest. Affection always leads to obstacles when it
is exploited. This is done by placing the importance of the personal
meaning that it gives us and the demand to keep receiving it over the true
needs of others. In the words of William Blake, “Love seeketh not itself to
please, nor for itself hath any care. It gladly gives itself with ease and
creates a heaven in hell’s despair.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many love only to receive love and recognition from others without
giving much themselves. Only when affection reaches a functional synergy
or symbiosis where both the lover and the loved interchange roles freely,
both harmoniously giving and receiving, that a person can truly begin to
realize the higher function of love. Human love in all of its forms is an
intimation, an emerging expression of divine love. Love is the only seed of
spirituality. One who is loved feels worthy and whole, regarded and
respected. The one who loves sees the power of transformation upon
another by and from their own emotive forces within.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the person feels love-worthy by others a noble confidence and self-
respect, or respectful Self awareness is gained that permits one to love
freely, without fear, selfish demands and an imposing personal need. And
are not fear, selfishness, and our personal demands and insistence the
tendencies that reflect a lack of true confidence, Self awareness and self-
respect, and therefore, a lack of love? Only a strong and integrated mind
can truly love. At this level of personal integration one understands how
love is the essential element, the magic elixir for the growth of soul that
cures all of the fear, selfishness, and suffering in life. One sees how oneself
has been transformed by it and cant help but want to share it with others.
This is the culmination of personal love: to love without strings attached
and not to expect anything in return. Love ceases to be a mere feeling or
personal need but rather a spiritual principle with the deepest meaning and
power. When this stage is reached an even deeper and universal spiritual
love can begin to emerge. This more exalted tendency is at the Vishuddha
(5th vortex). Love and affection begins at the Anahata but reaches its fullest
expression at the Vishuddha. Here affection as artha (personal meaning) is
fully transformed into dharma (universal and essential meaning). In the
end there is but one Friend, in many colors and in many places, who moves
through infinite love behind all our faces.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;By examining the spiritual heart we can begin to understand the reasons for the limitations the egocentric “I” notion that distorts the pure reflection of pure and infinite consciousness (“Hunab Ku” in Tantra Maya or “Shiva” and “Atman” in Indian tantra) in the human mind. Within the spiritual heart exist the roots of our divided and fragmented modern consciousness but also the qualities of compassion, understanding and unity with the true “I” within. All of the expressions of the so-called “vortexs” are balanced by understanding the spiritual heart, what yogis call the Anahata Chakra. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer to use the term “vortex” instead of “chakra.” The traditional symbol of the Anahata chakra is a lotus flower with 12 petals. Each “lotus petal” is literally a subtle energetic vortex spiraling out of the greater vortex or “lotus,” like many small tornadoes that group together to form one giant vortex. These petals or minor vortexes are known as vrttis- vortexes of mental energy. These vrttis vibrate the entire mind and body and qualify them so as to express particular states of thought and emotion. Vrttis are the fundamental intelligence behind our thoughts and feelings, the hidden programming of human cognitive and emotional life that vibrate the entire mind-body system. The Anahata Vortex is subtle like the higher vortexes with their finer, cognitive tendencies, but at the same time has grosser qualities like the lower vortexes that express more instinctual and egocentric tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until the Anahata Vortex the human being is but a “raging bundle of desire in a dying animal,” to use the words of Yeats.  It was said previously that the Manipura Vortex gives one an intimation of the infinite with its infinite desire for expansion, but falls short of the pure conception by projecting infinite desire on finite objects.  The Manipura at the navel is still governed by ontological hunger with its accompanying cravings, demands, and impositions on the objective world.  It can ask “how?” and then proceed to manipulate and maneuver the external world according to its internal desires, but it lacks the self-reflective conscience to ask “why?” or “what for?” in a deeply moral sense.  The Manipura Vortex is balanced only when it is under the guidance of the more conscious and moral Anahata.  It should be very clear to the reader that much of the present day ills in our materialistic and capitalistic pseudo-culture are due to the over activation and exploitation of the Manipura Vortex. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Anahata” means not harming and it is at this layer of mind that truly rational, self-reflective, compassionate, and judicious human qualities begin to emerge.  It is the vortex located in the center of the chest and is often referred to as the “heart chakra.”  It is the fulcrum on which rests the directional flow of the human mind.  Below here the mind moves outward, toward matter.  Here and above the mind can move inward, toward pure Spirit, toward Hunab Ku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Anahata Vortex is associated with the Intuitive Mind (Vijinanamaya Kosa), the layer of mind associated with intuition and the aerial factor.  Instead of the Anahata Vortex via the Intuitive Mind being associated with the vibration of form, like the Manipura, it is here associated with the vibration of touch or impression.  With the Anahata’s functioning on this higher, elemental level it receives the subtle impressions, in the form of abstract ideas and intuitive feelings, which emanate from objects.  It has the possibility of perceiving a deeper idea of the essence of the object thought or felt upon, be it an object in nature or another living being.   The thought forms or archetypes of the Manipura, creative level are but manifestations of the original, formless ideas as they exist in the Vijinanamaya Kosa. The Intuitive Mind is the realm of pure ideas that Plato, Socrates, and the ancient Greek philosophers inquired about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Manipura Vortex (3rd Chakra, the “City of Jewels”) and the Creative layer of mind associated with it are endowed with intellect and creativity, the mind is still too preoccupied with the fiery, impulsive propensities that keep the mind moving outward, into the senses, which thereby prevent a deep, rational, and intuitive understanding of self and world.  The Manipura is about self-acquisition while the Anahata is about self-actualization.  Due to the relative lightness of the aerial factor and the self-reflective propensities associated with the Anahata, the mind is here able to reflect and gaze upon form from a more enlightened vantage point.  If the Manipura level of mind is likened to a fire that not only enlightens but also consumes the realm of form, the Anahata is like the lightness of a supine cloud that drifts languidly above the multitudinous forms in nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Anahata is only the beginning of a non-attachment that leads to a transcendence of the separate, phenomenal self.  The individual ego and will are still present but much more self-reflective and non-impulsive than the Manipura.  Here the ego and the will become an object for the understanding or discriminative mind to reflect upon.  And it is because there is now an abstract self concept that is rooted deeply in the Intuitive Mind , the personality (Aham) can not just be conscious of the desires and propulsions in the sub-conscious mind, but also redirect those very same tendencies to more conscious and intelligent outlets.  With this capacity to consciously redirect the propensities that fetter the mind into crude mental limitations, the Aham personality is then able to reflect more upon the nature of itself.  There is therefore a much greater manifestation of the pure and limpid I-feeling at the Anahata.  Instead of the self being bound up and defined by the restless, incessant activity of the ego or doer-I, the sense of self is now more of a witness of the ego’s activity.  The “I” is still bound to the ego to a degree but it is lucid enough to know that it is independent.  This deep sense of “I exist” or knowledge of self existence can question what tendencies lead toward an inner state of harmony and self understanding and which ones lead one further into spiritual and psychic bondage.  In short, a deep sense of morality and conscience is born here; one much deeper than a mere superego that was imposed from without at the Manipura level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is at the Anahata that we see the first manifestations of dharma or psycho-spiritual movement, the movement of the mind toward the spirit.  The sense of self abstracted from the senses and extroverted will can more freely pursue the inner life and seek higher meaning.  It can understand the way the Tao or the moral order of the universe functions so as to conform the individual will with that cosmic will.  The mind begins to understand that it is only through becoming a responsible, conscious, and whole person that there can be any real meaning in life.  The life lived only through the senses and passions and superficial form is now seen as a great bondage that can never bring any deep fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, the Anahata is only the beginning of self-transcendence.  There is the abstracted feeling of the “I” that is ultimately independent of all objective qualities but the identity is still bound and mediated by subtle mental concepts defining the nature of self.  There is not yet the undifferentiated and pure expression of the eternal I- feeling unmediated by the self-referential concepts of the Aham.  Although there is a great degree of the pure I-feeling present the mind still uses concepts to refer itself to the objective experiences that it is attached to (the memories, personal history or self-narrative, self-defining characteristics, intellectual and emotional qualities, etc).   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be said that the Anahata Vortex is the occupation of the mind with the “I.”  The ego or Aham is not necessarily seeking to indulge in its limited self, but seek its origin in the I-feeling.  The problem comes about when this fascination with the nature of ones consciousness is projected into one’s finite self-concept.  All of the growth energy of self discovery instead goes into some form of egotism.  Vanity, narcissism, selfishness, and hypocrisy are the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half the 12 vrttis of the Anahata are “positive,” growth promoting vrttis and the other half are “negative” or at most neutral, self-justifying defense tendencies that perpetuate the ego’s limited boundaries instead of expanding and refining them.  There is still a limited and bounded sense of self, but with the potential to discriminate between vice and virtue.  There is also still the boundary of self and not self to be overcome, although not as marked as in the Manipura and Svadhistana.  Harmony, balance, and proportion are key elements in this fulcrum that is the Anahata to help determine what is growth-promoting and virtuous (self, or good for the self) and what is vice, or inappropriate for spiritual self-growth (not self).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Anahata there appear to be two hexagons. Really, there is one.
They seem different because one moves clockwise or centrifugally, and the
other moves counter-clockwise or centripetally. Here we can see the
fundamental yin-yang or centrifugal-centripetal interplay of the universe at
work within the human mind. Together these forces combine to make the Anahata Vortex.  These are 12 points at which the balance and imbalances of the human consciousness may express themselves in a refined way. When there is perfect balance and there is no escape through any vortex or vrtti in the 12 vertices, Shiva (Hunab Ku) always enters the human mind through the spiritual heart with its neutral force of consciousness or citishakti.  Citishakti is the Consciousness that controls Shakti, creative energy because this divine creative energy has its essence in Shiva, or Consciousness.  Shiva and Shakti are like fire and its capacity to burn; they are completely and eternally inseparable. All creation in this universe is due to the activity of Shakti and the conscious base of Shiva that silently witnesses the play of creation while at the same time offering its being as the essence on which Shakti may create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right side of the Anahata is dominated by the solar or centrifugal energy of Shakti. The left side of the Anahata is lunar or centripetal Shakti. The centrifugal force under the control of the witnessing entity of Shiva becomes the Son, the primordial creative expression of the Supreme Consciousness within the human and personal medium. It is for this reason that the Vedantic sages meditated on the right
side of the spiritual heart, the nexus of where the super-personal Atman
“touches” the personal and human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The left side of the Anahata is the “Mother of God”, the centripetal energy of Shakti that always brings the expressions of the Son (the centrifugal movement of creation) back to the neutral force of Shiva-Consciousness. The centripetal force never lets the centrifugal force become entirely lost into manifold expression and always brings it back to center. Together, in balance, these binary forces of creation manifest in the human being to the grade that there is a balance in the 12 vortices or vrttis at the 12 vertices of the 2 hexagons. When there is less duplicity,
arrogance, vanity, and selfishness(negative vrttis), and more love,
discernment and faith (positive vrttis), then the process of the unification of
the microcosmic consciousness into the Macrocosmic Consciousness of
Shiva is well under way. It is here in the spiritual heart of Anahata that the nameless, transcendental godhead may evolve a name for itself, for us, within each of us.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;black-crows&quot;&gt;Black Crows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pluma Blanca arrived at the ranch the other day.  He came just at the right time as I was completely exhausted with the defense of our ranch against the Santa Muerte neighbors.  Whenever these demons kidnap and torture people they turn on a motorcycle without a muffler that is very noisy and covers the screams of the tortured.  I had hardly slept for a week because they turned on that motorcycle every night between midnight and 3 a.m., the traditional “witching hour” when dark occultist have traditionally performed their rights.  Instead of sleeping, I meditated all through these dark hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Santa Muerte is the death cult of some narco groups. They really do practice death rituals. We practice life rituals. They call in their demonic helpers and we call in our friends, both embodied and disembodied. Our “dance of the blessed spirits” is to help us create a spiritual vortex of resistance against all forms of degeneration in order to preserve our species, a united human clan existing within the Supreme Consciousneness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ranch was recently invaded by a flock of crows.  They come and attack the other birds.  We had almost no birds here in the desert until we dug our trenches to collect rainwater and make a mini oasis.  To me, it seemed a perfect literary image: all of this suffering and death adorned with a final, dreadful touch of black crows that prey on our peaceful dove and sparrow.  It was as if reality is communicating with me through symbols.  Its uncanny, but is it just my imagination?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pluma Blanca began beating his drum and shouting in Maya and then chanting “Baba Nam Kevalam.”  I ran outside from my meditations and was inspired to go and attack the narco compound with my bare hands, such was the inspiration.  He was chasing off the crows.  I understood that he saw them as an ominous symbol.  He pointed to the crows and then to the direction of the narco compound.  I intuitively understood that he saw the crows as a live symbol connected with the narco camp.  If we run them off, then we effect those whom they serve.  It all made a certain symbolic sense, and I went along with it all in a high state of emotion and put my intellectual questions aside for the moment.  At that time we begin to hear the motorcycle.  It gets closer and we see a man riding it and shouting like a madman.  It was the first time we had seen the motorcycle and the rider leave the compound.  We had a chance to look him in the eyes and send him a gaze that penetrated his entire being.  He won’t come around any longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have lived with indigenous Mexican indians for the last 13 years.  Although I sometimes doubt their credulity in such magic realities, I have seen so many occasions in which these ideas have lead to the most amazing revelations of truth.  Pluma Blanca was a very refined yogi. My wife was his favorite student. He understood all of these practices without superstition and myth and taught very advanced, systematic meditations to understand these “magical realities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-parapsychologist-please&quot;&gt;A Parapsychologist, Please&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day a woman who helps us here in our gardens was returning home to the local village. On the way home she was approaching a lake which is just about 1/2 km from here. She heard a muffled gunshot, as if fired from close range. She thought somebody must be sacrificing a cow or goat that was injured or ill by the lake. A moment later she sees a figure of a man in a plaid shirt running away from the lake and into the bare desert. He promptly disappears and it made her doubt if there really was a figure. However, she was certain there was and knew it wasn’t her imagination. She checked to see if he left any tracks in the sand but she didn’t see any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As she got even closer to the lake she saw that there were police vehicles there. She saw them removing the body of a man with the same plaid shirt as the figure who was running away from the lake. Unfortunately, our once quiet little valley has turned into Buchenvald and this happens all of the time. We have an embarrassing gas problem around here, you know, the Haliburton kind. Do the narcos work for them? Hopefully the world is tuned into this; we are sitting ducks. Too bad there are all of these poor people around here that need to go away before the gas wells are drilled. I wonder how those that plan these schemes justify it to their warped conscience? What kind of story do they tell to themselves or their families?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meanwhile I ponder what it is she saw. Was it a premonition like a pre-cognitive event that occurs before something that really overwhelms the mind? For example, many mothers will have this type of pre-cognition at the same time their children suffer an accident far away. Or was it the perception of the murdered man’s spirit escaping the scene of a terrible death. Or has Quetzal Bill been into the peyote patch? That is a joke of course. Anybody who knows me knows that I take these weird phenomenon very seriously and I always try to see it from all angles. I lean more toward my first idea of a pre-cognitive event but I am open to suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Baba Nam Kevalam is a Sanskrit mantra that means “Only Love Is.” There is no other reality than this infinite bliss. We may approach It in so many ways: through sublime thoughts, good actions with sincere love for others and even through aesthetics. This mantra can be sung or chanted with any elevating melody and with any style of music. We use it as a form of spiritual practice to purify the environment and prepare for meditation. It also generates such positivity that protects us from the dangers here in our local community. The following is one of our recent recordings with the intention of driving the Santa Muerte out of our valley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Include file ‘gallery images=images caption=”” cols=3’ contains invalid characters or sequences
I was initiated into Tantra Yoga in 1993. I was taught in the very pure and secretive Rajadhiraja Tantra Yoga tradition by a very adept Indian yogi, Shambushivananda, a disciple of Anandamurti.  Within a few months the kundalini began with what would be a very long and intense awakening. As a student of psychology and world literature, I had heard of kundalini and other mystical energies but I had never thought they were real, live forces.  I thought it was just interesting archaic symbolism, and not an actual force within the human body that rises up through the spinal column to awaken higher states of awareness.  The universal symbol for this force is the serpent. It is said to be a covert, spiritual force beneath the surface of conscious awareness, like a coiled snake. Kundalini is the fundamental intelligence behind life and evolution, waiting to be awakened when the mind finally desires liberation from finite mental bondages. As this divine “serpent power” rises through the spinal column, one experiences states of deep spiritual realization. For the yogi, kundalini is the force that unites the human with the divine.
One day after classes and a short meditation, at which I was merely a beginner, I laid down on my back due to exhaustion. I felt a soothing force begin to rise up my spine. As this point of white, soft energy rose up into the thoracic region of the spine, I began to hear the sacred Om sound.  It became frightening because there was only Om and nothing else. I opened my eyes but could not see anything. My faculties of sight and hearing were unified and there only existed Om. I knew I was being dissolved in a force that was vibrating within every particle of the universe. It was ecstatic and exhilarating but terrifying. I felt my whole identity would disappear and never return. The kundalini was entering the medulla. I began to repeat my mantra for meditation but it only made the experience more intense. Instead, I began to repeat my name, William Ernest Enckhausen III over and over and trying to remember that I was a student in Austin, Texas on the physical plane of reality. The kundalini began to go back down as Om diminished. I couldn’t take any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that experience I became very confident but experienced a lot of mental turmoil.  It was very productive turmoil in that all negative memories from my past were being quickly purged and purified. I began to feel completely whole and that I had already lived a very complete life. The second time the kundalini rose was a few months later. I saw the same light in my spine although this time it was an infinitesimally small point. Physical reality disappeared and I began to “see” from the crown of my head a turquoise bird flying closer and closer as the point rose higher and higher. The bird landed on the crown of my head at the same time the point rose to the same place. Heaven and earth had met and I was lost in an infinite web of sound vibration where I could no longer see even this beautiful vision. And it was even many more years later that I learned forms of Mayan meditations very similar to Indian Tantra from a recluse indigenous teacher from Chiapas who recently died at the age of 110.
My last thought before losing awareness of not just the outer world, but also the inner world of vision, was that the forms looked Meso-American. Only years later would I learn of the Mayan concept of kundalini, what they call Kulkukan, the Plumed Serpent.
(This same image was named Quetzalcoatl by the Toltecs. A version of the image of Quetzalcoatl is on the Mexican national flag to this day. The turquoise bird that I saw was actually a quetzal, a beautiful colorful bird in Mexico and Central America.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this I became a freak. I lost all interest in a career and marriage and a “normal” life. I barely graduated the university and went to India seeking more understanding. There I met Chidghananda, a solitary old monk well-venerated in his order. He was regarded as a saint and I felt so honored that he took me into his close friendship and care. Sometimes I would accompany him with his evening meditations.  He always heard the holy Om sound and it increased in his meditation. It was obvious that he regularly experienced ananda, divine bliss. He was truly one of the most loving human beings that I have ever met. My experiences had intensified near him at Ananda Nagar and it was clearly divine will that I had met such a teacher to guide me through these powerful processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time I wanted to become a monk but Chidghananda himself told me that I was a bit of an oddity and would not fit in well with the monastic organization.  He said that my spiritual work was coming to an end, and that I didn’t really need to do anything else with my life rather than meditate, live simply, and help others as much as I could.  Although sharply criticized for his influence over me, he followed his conscience and spoke only the truth to me.   Although very confused as to what to do with my life once the ideal of being a monk was fading, I was aided by a dream in which Anandmurti commanded me not to worry about becoming a monk, but just to “see the world as a frame-less photo and wander through the night.” Anandamurti has always spoken to me through dreams in such an elevated, poetic fashion.  Later, as a confirmation he told me in another vivid dream that “all that matters is to do dhyana dasha.”  He used those Sanskrit words, one of which I knew of not until a friend looked it up in a Sanskrit dictionary. What Anandamurti said was “all that matters is to do service through meditation.” I was often unsure if in these dreams I communicated with the spirit of Anandamurti, or if Anandamurti had become a mere symbol in my consciousness that had penetrated my dreams.  Either way, these dreams always made perfect sense to me and enlightened difficult situations.  If they were my own projections, then they came from the deepest, most intuitive parts of me that have never let me down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was soon after that I met Chandranath and his wife, Ram Pari Devii. They were some of the first initiates and spiritual teachers, or acharyas, personally taught by Anandamurti in the 1950’s.  They were undoubtedly the most spiritually elevated beings that I have ever met. The whole environment around them was bliss. Even their lifelong employees, like the cook and the gardener, had become highly developed yogis. Speaking with Chandranath removed any doubts I had about my meditation and he told me that the intensity would calm down with time. He gave me invaluable tips about the mystical subtleties of spiritual practice and left me with the deepest sensation of divine peace that I still feel each time I recall being in his presence. Both he and his wife were established in the practice of samadhi (experiential union with the Supreme Consciousness) and could enter into it at will. They were free, realized souls whose only reason to still be physically incarnated was to help others along the path. After meeting them I realized that more important than being a monk or householder was to simply try to be at one with the Supreme Consciousness at all times, as they were. There are still some great disciples of Anandamurti and teachers of Rajadhiraja Yoga in Acharyas IIshvarakrsnananda, Japananda, Shantatmananda, Krpananda, Anandadhotana, and Anandamitra, to mention a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Name to the Nameless is a work in which I explain my personal experiences in the format of philosophy and psychology. Instead of continuing to write about very subjective mystical experiences, I decided to explain my experiences by going more deeply into Tantric spiritual science. Experience proves theory and I have discovered that Tantra is a universal spiritual science that sprouts up about all over the world, not just in India, Tibet and China, but in Meso-america as well. Who knows where else in the world exist traces of this secretive spiritual science? Most of my early inspiration was due to the spiritual influence of Anandamurti and a few of his disciples, like Chidghananda and Chandranath. Quetzal Manik, or “White Feather,” was my wife’s teacher whose Tantra Maya practices only deepened my understanding of the Indian Tantra I had been practicing for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction-tantra-as-a-practical-realization-of-the-perennial-philosophy&quot;&gt;Introduction:  Tantra as a Practical Realization of the Perennial Philosophy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has never been nor will there ever be a more exalted inspiration than the realization of the oneness of the human soul with the Infinite Being. This is an ever-renewing germ of thought in the perennial philosophy that will sprout wherever there are noble hearts and great minds that seek to love and understand the deepest parts of our being.  The greatest sages of all eras and cultures have proclaimed this great truth: that the deepest source of a human being’s existence is at one or in union with the Supreme Consciousness.  The universality of such a cardinal idea is not necessarily due to the cultural transmission of a great seer to others following his or her cultural descent, nor is it necessarily due to the influences of one culture upon another.  Its universality represents the realization of spiritual aspirations innate to the nature of humanity.  For an individual to understand the essence of one’s inner “I” which transcends all of the particularities of his/her biological inheritance, cultural orientation, social conditioning, and personal tastes, is to know the essence of the universal “I”, the infinite consciousness and life-source of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental spirit of this book is an attempt to understand the psychological and spiritual processes involved in the realization of the Infinite.  The explanation of these processes will be described within the theoretical and practical framework of the intuitive science of Tantra.  Instead of being a religious or philosophical system of thinking, Tantra is an experiential and intuitive science that is based on spiritual practice or sadhana.    Theory explains the how and why and is verified by one’s own experience through the intuitive introspection of sadhana.   Intuition and empiricism aren’t separate ideas in Tantra.  Just because something is experienced on the internal levels of mind, doesn’t mean it isn’t a “practical experience.”  The greatest human discoveries have always been intuitive, even intellectual and scientific realizations.  The practice and outlook of Tantra encompasses not just the spiritual and internal planes of existence, but the intellectual, emotional, and physiological as well.  The explanation of the mental and spiritual processes involved in the quest for our self-realization must examine the whole spectrum of human consciousness from the “simian to the seraphic.” One must understand  all of the modes of thought and expressions of feeling that influence one’s soul.  It is also necessary to understand how one changes and evolves from one stage of thinking and feeling to the next. Most importantly, Tantra sadhana is the quest to  liberate the mind from the complexes and fetters that bind it in limited identifications that cloud our thought and narrow our feeling.  Intuitive understanding gives mental freedom, peace and purity.  With intuition, the radiance of the eternal, inner “I” becomes simple and self-evident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To realize a spiritual philosophy and worldview that comprehends our nature as a whole may seem especially difficult  in an age where scientific, empirical knowledge is so specialized and compartmentalized. The modern scientific disciplines are so fragmented and isolated from the other disciplines within their broad family. However, science seems to see no other alternative than to fragment and isolate in order to reach precision and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tantra literally means expansion from crudity.  It is a process to transform the instinct into intellect and further transform intellect in to intuition, where head and heart are so perfectly balanced.  The uniqueness of the Tantric approach is that spiritual practice and realization follow certain psychic and spiritual laws that are embedded in the subtle nature of the mind.  There are mental dynamics and laws that function just as clearly as gravitational force functions in the physical world, for example.  This subtle knowledge is discovered through the trials of sadhana, of inner experimentation in the mental laboratory.  Aurobindu termed this process “mystical empiricism.”
So often one thinks that a scientific approach to knowledge is only antithetical to a spiritual and intuitive means to higher knowledge. And there is certainly good reason for this. One has not only to look at intellectual and cultural history with all of the conflicts of faith versus reason.  One can see the contemporary disparities between knowledge of the physical world opposed to knowledge of the mental and spiritual spheres.  Science can rationally explain our physical world to some extent.  However, it is very rare to find people or institutions that can explain the spiritual and deeply psychological layers of our being in a rational, lucid and methodical manner.  Most of the time spirituality is seen as religious dogma and conventional belief systems instead of a practical science.  One of the greatest struggles that human culture faces today is the reconciliation of the scientific world view with a modern and rational spiritual world view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This synthesis of the spiritual and scientific approach is possible without deadening an integrated, holistic spiritual outlook with the tyranny of scientific materialism and reductionism.  What is needed is a philosophy that recognizes the transcendental unity behind the changing and ephemeral phenomenon of nature while at the same time recognizing creation or nature from a perspective of the most heightened, benevolent and refined spiritual intellect:  an intellect so pinnacled it conceives the essence of things while at the same time upholding “sharply delineated concepts,” as Steiner puts it.  Therefore, we must realize that not even the fall of a sparrow can happen without the cosmic will but to also know the hidden, esoteric cause.  We must perceive and conceive the subtle mechanisms that bring about the manifestation of cosmic will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a spiritually oriented mind there is no end to the capacity to understand this universe.  In accordance with Tantric theory, we can understand and conceptualize everything in this creation be it crude matter or subtle mind.  The only limitation to our knowledge is in defining our inner “I” consciousness.  What is meant is not the common use of the term consciousness as particular perspectives and idiosyncrasies of an individual. Consciousness is rather the fundamental Witness that is the hub of the identity, a Supreme Subjectivity.  All of the personal qualities, experiences, feelings, and intellect are but spokes stemming from the hub of the Supreme Consciousness.  All that exists is seen by the Supreme Consciousness.  There is no existence apart from this, only the illusion of our separateness.  Our deepest subjectivity or sense of Self is in essence the immediate, inner presence of the Supreme Consciousness. The Upanishads ask, “How can the Knower be known?” The Supreme Consciousness witnesses and sees all minds and hearts from its state of pure, subjective Consciousness and cannot become an object even for the most refined intellect.  The only way to know the Absolute is to become one with it, to merge into it by discerning its reality within the inner feeling of “I-exist” and to know and feel that you are It.  This refined, mindful, intuitive vision is the essence of mysticism.  This is the highest spiritual knowledge and existential realization possible in Tantra: to be and live in union with the Supreme Consciousness.
And what about the stages along the journey?  Are there realms of being in-between the relative physical world and the Absolute?  Are there simply name and form here and namelessness and formlessness there?  Or does the spiritual and contemplative life becomes so nebulous and abstruse that we entirely abandon our intellect and language when things become subtle?   And what of the passions and sentiments?  What is their place and purpose in existence? A truly spiritual outlook must have the scope of understanding the array of feelings from the basest to the passionate to the most noble of human sentiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the times we live in, psychological balance and a deeper meaning of life is quite rare.  More rare is finding a spark of cosmic consciousness present within ones life.  The lot of humanity is moving towards self-alienation as meaningless pawns in a degenerated materialistic system with little or no regard for humanistic and spiritual endeavors.  It is no wonder that so many lives are governed by fear, resentment, insecurity, ambition, and vanity when there are so few healthy channels for human expression.  When a sincere person does try to open the  heart and mind, one finds so much inner conflict and confusion that the temptation to rejoin the herd-consciousness is almost irresistible.  One finds not the inner, blissful consciousness but rather a quagmire of self-doubt, repressed fears and complexes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we must find a solution, both as individuals and as a united human society.  We must not give way to fear and apathy and the repression of what is truest and pure in our nature.  Tantric philosophy and practice may give us such a deep understanding of the all of the mind’s existential and emotional needs that it is possible to understand and heal them.  With the integration of the psychological limitations one can progress onward toward the deeper, intuitive layers of mind until one finally understand the core of consciousness and purpose of life.  Finding this great “I” within liberates one from suffering and shows the way to freedom.  This inward gaze is a feeling of eternal joy, of knowing beyond all doubts that the internal “I” has always been free.   Our truest essence is bliss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Consciousness is the Self, the subject and witness of all created things- the mind, the body, and the entire universe.   This blissful, pure Self is so essentially unified with in us and so close that the mundane mind can’t even grasp it.  Mysticism is the process of revealing what is inside and hidden.  This mystical union is possible through the science of sadhana, spiritual practice.  Through cultivating our inner oneness with the infinite Consciousness  our entire being can indeed be gazed upon from that abode of bliss.
Through our union with the source of infinite knowledge, resourcefulness and creativity, all things are capable of being understood.  Within the universal mind, is the intuitive perspicacity to penetrate the secrets of heaven, the subtle worlds, or divine realms.  It can understand all things, including itself, up until the point it asks itself “from where have I come, what is my source?”  The Vedas even mention that Brahma, the Creator, does not even know its origin.  Only when mind attempts to fathom the unfathomable is it ultimately defeated, but defeated in bliss.  Like an arrow in its target, the mind becomes lost in Brahma. Mind dissolves in its essence and origin with that final inquiry.  “The only way to know Brahma is to become Brahma.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This understanding brings us to a very fine balance between the intuitive approach of eastern mysticism and the dynamism of the western intellect.  At one extreme is the complete transcendence of the mind, world, and body: at the other, the reduction of all things to matter.  So the modern contemplative must of course be able to tread the fathomless ground of the godhead, of the absolute, uncreated Brahma. While at the same time it is necessary to maintain an acute intellect and intuition that can fully comprehend all the spiritual and psychological processes along our journey through the physical, psychic and spiritual worlds.  With this harmonious balance of the inner (subjective) and outer (objective) spheres the individual attains his/her own emancipation by realizing the Infinite Being within one’s very own existence.  This realization  cultivates one’s deepest humanity  and gives the wisdom and compassion to care for and further the progress of all creation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Nietzche spoke of a rather odd phenomenon that he called the “Eternal Recurrence.”  According to this theory the reality that we construct by our own free will repeats itself eternally.  He was deeply immersed in Buddhist literature as a Sanskrit philologist and this idea seems to be a very original and subjective interpretation of the archetypal idea of reincarnation that he surely encountered in his studies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was 22 my mentor Chidghananda spoke to me of my supposed past lives.  He only did this because I playfully tricked him into it.  However, what he told me was very very serious and took away all sensational mystique of this phenomenon.  He only told me what I already knew, really.  He never exceeded that, but only clarified what were for me new revelations about my inner life.  Nobody had ever guided me so clearly in my personal development.  I had two very loving grandfathers in this earthly life, and Chidghananda beamed with the love of a hundred noble grandfathers.    He always spoke of his guru, whom he called “Baba.”  “Baba was Baba, a complete mystery,” he always told me.  He was an infinite mystery that he (Chidghananda) never tried to capture in any final, dogmatic conception.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were also some other spiritual grandfathers.  Some went on into &lt;em&gt;moksha&lt;/em&gt; at death (union with the godhead and no re-birth, similar to the idea of Nirvana), but many took &lt;em&gt;mukti&lt;/em&gt; (liberation from reincarnation but oneness with the eternal activity of the Cosmic Mind of Brahma or G.O.D.- Generator, Operator, Destroyer.) Those who enter into &lt;em&gt;mukti&lt;/em&gt; wait for the absolute emancipation of &lt;em&gt;moksha&lt;/em&gt; while they remain active and united with the Cosmic Mind serving the entire universe. They can get a lot of work accomplished because they are at one with the infinite and eternal activity of the mind of Brahma as opposed to being at one with the godhead beyond generation, operation, and destruction of the created universe that comes from the infinite source of the godhead.  Even the ones that went into moksha left some important gifts before their absolute union with the Infinite One beyond even the mind of Brahma.  They were a non-local, decentralized force for their departed guru and continue to pass on that sublime shakti within the collective mind of the living disciples from now into the future.  Chidghananda never died for me.  When he left his physical body I felt him near me whenever I thought of him.  He showed me the way to the guru in life and he only continues to do so in death.  Our Dead Dada’s Society is everywhere and nowhere; it is super-personal, decentralized, cosmicly free and wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chidghananda told me that my work was done, and that I only had to a little more of a martial form of meditation, or &lt;em&gt;sadhana&lt;/em&gt;.  Other than that, I had no other duties.  Sure, he told me I could write books, raise money for service projects or help out in any other way if possible, but my only real duty was to fulfill my spiritual duty with this sadhana.  After so many years of trying to understand this, I came to the conclusion that those days were but an experience of liberation from past samskaras (reactions to previous actions).  I was free to create new actions in the present.  This liberation has more to do with the realization of the inner “I” rather than the outer “I am” of the ego or personality.  The personality may still exist but it has no past nor pending desires.  Memories of life begin to be whitened, purified and unified in the eternal present beyond recurrence, even the eternal recurrence.  Yet Chidghananda further told me that I would pass through inconceivable sufferings but that I would never fall because the guru would guide even these difficult adventures.  Sure enough, there has been nothing but conflict and resolution, but also a little revolution.  Falls were controlled falls, always below and to the left.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dice of the gods are loaded.  No actions are original.  Free will only exists in theory.  When the past ceases to exist then the ego is a mirage and the question of “free will” becomes silly and infantile.  Only Brahma (The Macrocosm in itself) is real, yet one must continue to choose and act in the human world while paying the eternal sacrament of sacrificing the fruits of “independent” action into the eternal fire of Brahma.  Hence, the Cosmic Show, the Headkick Headtrick Tantra as an eternal recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I am hesitant to speak of past lives or future lives, I do think it is important to recognize the idea of “reincarnation” if we know that it really effects us in an experiential, phenomenal manner.  I think it is more important to see repeating cycles within ones present incarnation rather than try to see them in previous ones.  Shrii Cube once told me that he never wanted to know his past lives because he is only just beginning to understand his present one.  Nature is intelligent enough to show one’s samskaras through this very life if one develops a little intuition.  Life itself teaches all of the patterns of conditioning, both inherited and aquired, by always bringing us back to where our issues lie.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a strong spiritual awakening at 21 years of age.  Concurrently, I got caught up in an absurd revolution in West Bengal, India, where I was accused of being an arms dealer.  It was absurd because I was an innocent philosophy student hanging out at an Indian ashram.  Ananda Marga introduced me to Indian intelligence, Interpol, and the CIA.  I wanted nothing to do with this scene.  I came to distrust most people who wear uniforms in Ananda Marga.  I always retained a deep reverence for my teachers at Ananda Nagar, however.  Very few people in Ananda Marga were complicit with the CIA, but they were very key people who have helped disintegrate that organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, at age 42, I passed through another spiritual storm even stronger than when I was 21.  I had not been around Ananda Marga for 15 years but I heard news of how they want to sue us for publicly promoting their supposedly universal mantra, “Baba Nam Kevalam.”  We even got a death threat from an Avadhuta preist.  At the same time I went to visit the CIDECII, a cooperative university that serves the indigenous Zapatista communities of Chiapas.   I was actually spiritually inspired by their example of selfless service and heroic determination for justice.  Soon after that I was under surveillance once again.  I realized that the CIDECII was the think-tank of the most successful and progressive revolutionary movement on the continent.  Of course Big Brother is watching over them, they are the Zapatistas! My gmail and facebook accounts were hacked, my telephone was intervened and all internet activity was stifled.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent 6 months under house arrest in India waiting for our case in the Arms Drop case in which I came out completely clean.  Police were always watching me during that time.  While being watched I would joke with my Irish friend using my own thick Irish accent imitation that the Indian military police could not understand very clearly.  I made jokes about their sadistic leiutenant’s “fat arse.”  We roared with laughter always.  Last year, here in the present in Mexico, we have had many visits from many dangerous people- military, paramilitary, corporate military, narco-assassins and even a spy who later confessed.  They always seemed to come on days when I had very high meditations and no harm ever came to us.  Geronimo says they can go and frack themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so here we go again on the upward spiral path of eternal time, like a mountain pass that spirals upward.  Each spiral trip and return to previous points is a little higher and one can see the past with more clarity.  These higher cycles become shorter and faster as we strive for the apex point in the Atman.&lt;/p&gt;

While I was a student at UT, a group of drunken fraternity boys  pushed a piano through a window that fell 10 floors and killed 2 people in the street below. As if there were not a better use for a grand piano! All of these bone-heads got together and decided they were not responsible. They collectively blamed the victims. “Why were those stupid people walking the streets at 3 am?” they argued. My professor of social psychology marveled at this phenomenon of “cognitive dissonance.” Cognitive dissonance is a mental state that occurs when there is a major contradiction in the structures of the ego. A powerful event that is different and contradicts the projections of its habitual reality creates a state of dissonance and inner tension in the mind. Instead of being only superficial and frivolous boys, they are now guilty of killing innocent people. They thought they were good people, perhaps the best, and now they are seen as criminals. To neutralize this cognitive dissonance, this state of tension induced by a great contradiction and confusion to the ego’s reality, one has to invent excuses that serve the confused ego and create an acceptable story so that one can continue thinking in the same way as before so that one’s projections  about “reality” are not contradicted and interrupted. The psyche must avoid at all costs this painful state of cognitive dissonance. We are all cognitive misers and always look for excuses and pretexts rather than the complex truth. If you can not find an excuse, then you live in torment. In the case of frat boys, they can not bear the social censure and personal guilt and simply pass the blame on some “other”. This is, of course, much easier when each individual has the rest of the “team” supporting him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These superficial socialites with the Greek letters were often conformist nationalistic and patriotic types that become model citizens and good leaders in business and government. Does the irresponsibility of these students reflect the reality of society in general? We live in our isolated world and only care about our selfish well-being, or perhaps only our near and dear ones. How many people are concerned about economic wars and our military-industrial complex that undermine democracy by sabotaging the economies and governments of weaker nations?  Who thinks about environmental degradation, economic exploitation of other people on the planet, and widespread degeneration of the human soul trapped in this  materialistic, deterministic cage that so much of our world has become? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people are just repressed  frat boys on the inside. Most have a cold indifference or simply a flagrant ignorance and prefer to watch TV, eat Big Macs, and buy strange things to fill their emptiness. Who will criticize if everyone is living in the same way?  It can not be bad if everyone else is part of the scheme, if the national sentiment gives one an opiate to filter anything that creates this cognitive dissonance. Why not go on raising the flag a little higher than one’s cognitive dissonance? It enables individuals and society to continue their impunity and irresponsibility. How will the mundane and selfish American mentality ever change and take responsibility for the damage that is being created around the world with such a petty, self-centered bias which serves nothing but the base appetites? Most people who follow this kind of superficial ideology do not care about what happens to people in other places, as long as they continue to live in narcissistic overabundance. Their ideological distortions hide the ugly truth that they have to kill others to steal the natural resources and labor of others.  That’s why hardly anyone in the US  will believe that there is a genocide in Mexico, for example, and that his predatory lifestyle and political ignorance is responsible for so much destruction and suffering for the planet and its people. The first world is the parasite of the third.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I have received great benefits by being born in the US: a good family, education and a safe environment in which to live. However, when one peers out of the false security bubble of “The Truman Show”, develops a natural, spiritual and universal consciousness, one begins to see the terrible things that the politicians, bankers and corporations are doing to the world. So that a few can live in wretched excess, the masses of humanity have to live in misery. And for what end? The modern materialistic society of the United States is so full of mental pathologies that people often end up suffering more than the oppressed and exploited in the third world. Often I see more light in the eyes of the indigenous who live under tin roofs in the mountains than in the people of modern suburbs where I grew up. Though poor and forgotten, at least those people still have a piece of land and have not been overcrowded urban slums to be devoured by capitalist matrix. There are still people who are truly of this earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this situation is an absurd instability that can not last. At present there is an internal revolution within the intelligence systems of many governments around the world. Whistleblowers are emerging from behind so many nooks and crannies. There is a division between those who would sustain national solidarity against the will of the imperialist multinationals that benefit from this spread and perpetuate the violence that makes us all enemies. We overvalue their knowledge and power. Its existence is based on nothing more than the destruction and distortion of material and social reality. Behind the power that we give them, they are actually insecure and fearful people hiding behind the status-quo. Their only power is that our weaknesses and acceptance of their lies have not given us other solutions than their distortions, exploitation, and wars of annihilation. Whether American, Israeli, Mexican, etc., intelligence officials know that it is a show of blatant lies that cover a brutal reality and that their states are manipulated by  bankers and multinational corporations. Intelligence is a two-edged weapon. These people whose profession is a lie and create war and destruction are in a deep part of his psyche actually well aware of the weaknesses in their networks of lies. No matter how sick and distorted their minds have become there is always a live witness that sees through their game of lies. They are not dumb beasts, but degenerate intellectuals. There remains some portion of an inner intelligence that makes them uneasy and restless. To reflect and resound these lies back to them is the duty of all who love liberty and seek a better and more balanced world. Leaders play the game of psychological terror, as well as actual, aggressive terror. Should we not find a more subtle and intelligent way to return this destruction upon them? Should we not rise above their petty little ideologies and feelings with the highest universal humanism and spiritual strength to reflect their hell back upon them? Make the mind a laser that penetrates through this darkness to send this mass of foul lies back to the perpetrators. This refined interior light will protect you personally and help repel their attacks on our collective human society. We must tap our reserve forces in the deepest part of the mind to defend against this degeneration and impunity. Neurosis and psychosis is the natural result of most people who do not renounce the path of lies and destruction. Let them destroy themselves rather than others. The stronger you are, the more their own distortions fall back upon them. There is some good that torments this fragmented and sick state of existence. That is where to attack in silence and secrecy, as they will not be conquered by the “peace and love” entreaties. Their weakness is in the same point as their cognitive dissonance and false consciousness. What does the shrewd capitalist know of the greater forces in the universe, these demons who exploit and kill for finite matter, poor ideology and petty ego? Perhaps some will change, but most eventually be devoured by their own psychopathology because of such internal distortion. They are cunning, but a deeper moral intelligence connects us to true power and knowledge in the universe. They do not know the power of Tao, of dharma, the universal moral order of the universe. A mind without spiritual awareness is like a ship lost at sea, full of holes, and sinks slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leaders and also their followers also carry the burden of truth through the lie. Those who accept the popular lies also pay the price in the end. Although most are not aware that they are ultimately working towards truth, even through his own degeneration. The materialistic and narcissistic example of existence with all its pathology has given proof to the world of its unsustainability and its inevitable madness. This giant collapsing on itself is teaching many lessons to the world of how not to live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GERONIMO RELOADED 2015&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 4 danced and whirled around the mystical trinity in the divine triangle of Om above the pineal gland. They heard and understood all the sounds that compromise the divine triangle of OM. Each sound brought them closer to the center. They understood all 3 sides of the triangle as Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva and then arrived at the center. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, Commander Zero sends Geronimo and his Microvita Raiders with this magic vortex down to raid the center of the earth. There are so many electromagnetic fields to fix. These spirits have their own version of a new world order and want to put their own spin on to things. They stopped by Rancho el Misterio for some rest and relaxation after one such excursion. I asked them if all of this fracking in our zone had any effect on his raids and if he had a special message for the exploiters of the planet. Geronimo replied with assured confidence, “Tell them they can go and frack themselves!”&lt;/p&gt;

Desert rains abate. Now crickets join frogs in fugues.
How can any evil out-live this eternal creation that is always new?
We dug our trenches, collecting water for trees,
birds, insects, and animals all around.
Our home is an island of hope for many now.
Our trenches are a defense in war
against the elite above who annihilate us, below.
Be careful harming those below, for how low does their consciousness go,
those who hear frogs and fugues?&lt;/p&gt;

I try my best to write about mystical subjects. However, words just are never sufficient for mystical insight. I was once very ill after being around too many patients. A golden light passed through me and healed me. It just passed through me from the adobe wall behind me. It was a certain type of microvita. Some of the old people around here know about these benevolent entities. They call them the &amp;#8220;doraditos&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;golden beings.&amp;#8221; It inspired me to write a song. I only played it on the flute until my friends joined in with the lyrics, guitar and yukilele.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We belong to the golden race&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We come down to share grace&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;The subject of today’s discourse is “Cult, Inference and Propensity.” The path that leads or goads the aspirant unto Parama Puruśa is “cult” in the true spirit of the term. Where the goal is something finite, where the pabulum is something limited, the path and the movement cannot be treated as cult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spiritual practice is based on cult: adherence to the doctrine of cult is started and practised in the primordial phase by the doer “I” of all living beings. The doer “I” keeps on thinking, “I am working, I am eating, I am seeing, I do not know anything, I know so many things.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In living beings other than humans, the doer “I” is not properly expressed, and that is why they cannot establish their individual identity or do spiritual practice. In certain animals like dogs and monkeys, the doer “I” is a bit more expressed or developed than in other creatures. That is why in the future they may also be in a position to do this practice .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also remember that this doer “I” performs spiritual practice with the help of vital energy, not with the help of positive or negative microvita. In fact, the vital energy accelerates the speed of spiritual progress. Microvita, positive or negative, help the aspirant in his or her movement, but the aspirant cannot utilize the microvita.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the doer “I” of the aspirant is goaded towards the Supreme Entity, it uses the vital energy acquired through different quinquelemental factors, passing through different planes of inferences, and through different propensities of the human mind, without suppressing those propensities of the mind. The question of suppression, repression and oppression does not arise in the realm of spiritual cult. You are simply to maintain equilibrium and equipoise – that is, you are to move maintaining proper parallelism with the fundamental propensities of the human mind. So spiritual practice is performed by the doer “I” with the help of energy, of so many energies which are converted into vital energy when they pass through the different planes of inferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not proper to think that this movement, this spiritual advancement, is something purely of individual character. No entity in this universe exists individually. Ours is a universal family. Each and every entity – living and non-living, moving and non-moving – helps others in maintaining not only their equilibrium, but also the equipoise of the entire universe, not only of this small planet Earth. We are to move together with all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if an ant dies a premature death, it is bound to jeopardize the balance of the entire universe. Even if a 110 year old widow thinks that her life has no existential value on this planet, that she is a mere burden to society, it is a defective idea. No – even the life of such an old widow contributes to maintaining the balance of the universe. If such an old person dies prematurely, it is bound to jeopardize the balance of the universal society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If people think that they will make steady progress in the spiritual sphere even if the society goes to the dogs, they are mistaken. You who are genuine spiritualists should practise spiritual cult thinking that by doing so you will become effective in maintaining the universal balance. You must think, “I will personally move towards the supreme desideratum, and at the same time I will try to assist those who are suffering from despair, those steeped in blind superstition and those wallowing in poverty.” Our family is universal, our abode is also universal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hararme pitá gaorii mátá
Svadesha bhuvanatrayam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Universal Father, Shiva, is our Father. The Universal Mother, Gaorii, is our Mother. She is the causal matrix. And this universe is our homeland.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spiritual cult is the only cult; others are not cult, they are mere dogma. If the cult is proper – if it is cult in the true spirit of the term – it creates a sort of subtlety in one’s mental flow. Under such circumstances, we receive necessary help from positive microvita. This help that we receive by dint of our spiritual practices is composed of eight occult powers. These powers are known as “occult” because they are acquired through cult. But while acquiring these occult or so-called “miraculous” powers, we cannot do anything without the help of positive microvita. These occult powers are ańimá, laghimá, mahimá, iishitva, vashvitva, prakámya, prápti and antaryámitva. The entity who is endowed with all of them is known as “Iishvara”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ańimá means “converting one’s psychic existence into a small point and then transforming it into a minimum entity.” One may understand anything by entering into each and every physical particle and becoming one with the different waves of expression and emanation, by dancing with the wavelengths of objects or ideas. Unless and until one’s very psychic existence is converted into a point, one cannot move or dance according to the wavelengths of objects or ideas. This occult power acquired through positive microvita is called “ańimá”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laghimá makes the mind light, free from the bondages of so many liabilities. This carefree mind, freed from the fetters of materialistic bondages, can understand and think properly. So by dint of this occult power, one may understand any idea, subtle or crude, in the abstract realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you understand how much pain and sorrow is accumulated in others’ minds, how many tears well up in their eyes, you cannot alleviate their sorrows and sufferings. Through laghimá, you can acquire this particular power to study others’ minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third one is mahimá or expansion of mind. With the help of positive microvita, mind can be expanded. The radius of the mind may cover the entire universe, and we may have ideas about different subjects even without reading books and literature. And in this way, too, we may feel our oneness with the varied entities of this universe – unity in variety, unity in diversity. By associating our benevolent thoughts with each and every entity, we will contribute to universal progress and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iishitva enables the spiritual aspirant to guide other minds who suffer from different psychic ailments. So many people in this world are crying in pain and agony. So many miseries and afflictions have paralysed human beings physically and mentally. In leading this afflicted humanity to their physical progress and psychic well-being, this occult power of iishitva will help you tremendously. It can be achieved through positive microvita which is in turn acquired through the regular practice of cult. By sitting idle and crying constantly one cannot achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vashvitva helps a person to bring defective ideas, or people goaded by defective ideas, unto the path of supreme greatness. If people are to be guided towards their definite progress, they will first have to be brought under one’s control. If such people work haphazardly and do not follow the right path, they cannot be expected to reach the state of welfare. So, if you really want to help people, you will have to bring them under control and then direct them along the right path to their goal. This occult power can be achieved through positive microvita.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prakámya or the right mode of thinking aimed at promoting universal welfare, brings light to the entire universe. Through this occult power, spiritual aspirants acquire what is needed to serve the entire world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prápti means helping oneself and helping the souls of so many people to acquire and be benefited by the grace of the supreme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the eighth one is antaryámitva – to be able to enter within the ectoplasmic or endoplasmic structures of others, and thereby to know the pains and pleasures, the hopes, aspirations and longings of others to guide them properly. It is somewhat like the transmigration of souls. Regarding this eighth occult power, spiritual cult alone will not suffice – it requires the special grace of Parama Puruśa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is yet another occult power – the power of omniscience, to be all-knowing. This power of omniscience cannot be achieved only through the practice of cult, nor with the help of positive microvita – one must reach the height of devotion and achieve the grace of the supreme. Otherwise, even if people dash their heads against a wall, they still cannot acquire omniscience with the help of positive microvita.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And above all occult powers is the supreme knowledge – ensconcement in Parama Puruśa. This is not only a sort of omniscience, rather it elevates the aspirant to be one with the supreme cognitive faculty. Of course, those who are already endowed with devotion will automatically acquire this power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bhaktih bhagavato sevá, bhaktih prema svarúpińii,
Bhaktiránanda rúpáca, bhaktih bhaktasya jiivanam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Devotion means service unto the Lord. Devotion is of the nature of selfless love. Devotion is bliss incarnate. Devotion is the very life of the devotee.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devotion means working in the service of the Supreme according to His satisfaction. Without devotion, one’s mind cannot rise beyond the pituitary gland – if one wants to take the mind beyond that, one needs devotion. So the supreme spiritual progress of microcosms is never possible without devotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have devotion, you can call Parama Puruśa to you; He will certainly come to you, rather He must come to you. For this, you may or may not have anything else, but if you have devotion, you have everything. By dint of that, one attains Parama Puruśa, one becomes identified with Him. This is the summum bonum of human life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding prema or selfless love, it is said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samyauṋmasrńito shánto mamatvátishayáunkitah;
Bháva sá eva sándrátmá budhaeh prema nigadyate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The attitude which makes the mind smooth and placid, and radiant with the deepest love for the Lord, is called “bháva”. Wise people call this “prema” or “divine love”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prema is the attraction for Parama Puruśa overcoming the attraction for all other finite objects. Those who are endowed with such divine love are bound to receive the grace of Parama Puruśa – they need not worry about it. If they practise the spiritual cult regularly, positive microvita are sure to help them. Those who arouse devotion through action and knowledge are certain to attain the grace of Parama Puruśa. This grace need not be huge in quantity – even a wee bit of it will be enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mahatkrpayaeva bhagavatkrpáleshádvá.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One can attain the supreme stance by the blessings of the exalted ones, as well as a wee bit of Macrocosmic grace.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only such people endowed with the grace of the supreme are in the best position to render maximum service to this universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While practising spiritual cult, it should be remembered that spiritual aspirants must not practise in order to acquire these occult powers. The goal of spiritual practice is to realize the Supreme Entity. To search for any other thing is wrong. Occult powers are just like the dust on the roadside. The attraction for Parama Puruśa is the most valuable object – all else is only the dust of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence the spiritual aspirant must not run after these inconsequential occult powers, although while prasticing spiritual cult they may develop. You must not forget that all your achievements must maintain adjustment with the main propensities of the mind, and in the process of adjustment, all these eight types of occult powers present themselves to the spiritual aspirant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sádhaná starts in the plane of physicality and moves towards the physico-psychic plane. This first phase of sádhaná is performed by the “doer I”. Then from the physico-psychic plane to the pure psychic plane, and from the pure psychic plane to the psycho-spiritual plane – this portion of sádhaná is done by the “knower I”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the final stage of sádhaná, the pure spiritual phase, none of these can help the spiritual aspirant; even positive and negative microvita cannot function above the psycho-spiritual level, beyond the pituitary gland. No vibration is of any help. In such circumstances, finally you will have to depend on the grace of the supreme and nothing else. One is obliged to declare, Brahmakrpáhi kevalam, that is, the grace of Parama Puruśa is everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything in this universe is created, everything survives and everything ultimately dissolves in and through Him. Regarding this Supreme Entity, the scriptures say,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yato vishvaḿ samudhútaḿ
Yena játaiṋca tiśthati;
Yasmin sarváni liiyanta
Jineyam tadbrama lakśanach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Out of the grace of the supreme, the universe has emerged; due to His grace, the universe preserves its existence; and because of His grace, everything will finally dissolve in Him.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the final word in the realm of spirituality is the supreme grace of Parama Puruśa. Intelligent people will understand this supreme truth and move accordingly. It is true not only in the physical level, nor in the physico-psychic level, nor in the psychic, nor in the psycho-spiritual level, but in all levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, whatever you say or think, everything is finally embedded in the grace of Parama Puruśa. The sooner this fundamental truth is realized, the better it will be for all.&lt;/p&gt;

By examining the spiritual heart we can begin to understand the reasons for the limitations the egocentric “I” notion that distorts the pure reflection of pure and infinite consciousness (“Hunab Ku” in Tantra Maya or “Shiva” and “Atman” in Indian tantra) in the human mind. Within the spiritual heart exist the roots of our divided and fragmented modern consciousness but also the qualities of compassion, understanding and unity with the true “I” within. All of the expressions of the so-called “vortexs” are balanced by understanding the spiritual heart, what yogis call the Anahata Chakra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer to use the term “vortex” instead of “chakra.” The traditional symbol of the Anahata chakra is a lotus flower with 12 petals. Each “lotus petal” is literally a subtle energetic vortex spiraling out of the greater vortex or “lotus,” like many small tornadoes that group together to form one giant vortex. These petals or minor vortexes are known as vrttis- vortexes of mental energy. These vrttis vibrate the entire mind and body and qualify them so as to express particular states of thought and emotion. Vrttis are the fundamental intelligence behind our thoughts and feelings, the hidden programming of human cognitive and emotional life that vibrate the entire mind-body system. The Anahata Vortex is subtle like the higher vortexes with their finer, cognitive tendencies, but at the same time has grosser qualities like the lower vortexes that express more instinctual and egocentric tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until the Anahata Vortex the human being is but a “raging bundle of desire in a dying animal,” to use the words of Yeats. It was said previously that the Manipura Vortex gives one an intimation of the infinite with its infinite desire for expansion, but falls short of the pure conception by projecting infinite desire on finite objects. The Manipura at the navel is still governed by ontological hunger with its accompanying cravings, demands, and impositions on the objective world. It can ask “how?” and then proceed to manipulate and maneuver the external world according to its internal desires, but it lacks the self-reflective conscience to ask “why?” or “what for?” in a deeply moral sense. The Manipura Vortex is balanced only when it is under the guidance of the more conscious and moral Anahata. It should be very clear to the reader that much of the present day ills in our materialistic and capitalistic pseudo-culture are due to the over activation and exploitation of the Manipura Vortex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Anahata” means not harming and it is at this layer of mind that truly rational, self-reflective, compassionate, and judicious human qualities begin to emerge. It is the vortex located in the center of the chest and is often referred to as the “heart chakra.” It is the fulcrum on which rests the directional flow of the human mind. Below here the mind moves outward, toward matter. Here and above the mind can move inward, toward pure Spirit, toward Hunab Ku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Anahata Vortex is associated with the Intuitive Mind (Vijinanamaya Kosa), the layer of mind associated with intuition and the aerial factor. Instead of the Anahata Vortex via the Intuitive Mind being associated with the vibration of form, like the Manipura, it is here associated with the vibration of touch or impression. With the Anahata’s functioning on this higher, elemental level it receives the subtle impressions, in the form of abstract ideas and intuitive feelings, which emanate from objects. It has the possibility of perceiving a deeper idea of the essence of the object thought or felt upon, be it an object in nature or another living being. The thought forms or archetypes of the Manipura, creative level are but manifestations of the original, formless ideas as they exist in the Vijinanamaya Kosa. The Intuitive Mind is the realm of pure ideas that Plato, Socrates, and the ancient Greek philosophers inquired about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Manipura Vortex (3rd Chakra, the “City of Jewels”) and the Creative layer of mind associated with it are endowed with intellect and creativity, the mind is still too preoccupied with the fiery, impulsive propensities that keep the mind moving outward, into the senses, which thereby prevent a deep, rational, and intuitive understanding of self and world. The Manipura is about self-acquisition while the Anahata is about self-actualization. Due to the relative lightness of the aerial factor and the self-reflective propensities associated with the Anahata, the mind is here able to reflect and gaze upon form from a more enlightened vantage point. If the Manipura level of mind is likened to a fire that not only enlightens but also consumes the realm of form, the Anahata is like the lightness of a supine cloud that drifts languidly above the multitudinous forms in nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Anahata is only the beginning of a non-attachment that leads to a transcendence of the separate, phenomenal self. The individual ego and will are still present but much more self-reflective and non-impulsive than the Manipura. Here the ego and the will become an object for the understanding or discriminative mind to reflect upon. And it is because there is now an abstract self concept that is rooted deeply in the Intuitive Mind , the personality (Aham) can not just be conscious of the desires and propulsions in the sub-conscious mind, but also redirect those very same tendencies to more conscious and intelligent outlets. With this capacity to consciously redirect the propensities that fetter the mind into crude mental limitations, the Aham personality is then able to reflect more upon the nature of itself. There is therefore a much greater manifestation of the pure and limpid I-feeling at the Anahata. Instead of the self being bound up and defined by the restless, incessant activity of the ego or doer-I, the sense of self is now more of a witness of the ego’s activity. The “I” is still bound to the ego to a degree but it is lucid enough to know that it is independent. This deep sense of “I exist” or knowledge of self existence can question what tendencies lead toward an inner state of harmony and self understanding and which ones lead one further into spiritual and psychic bondage. In short, a deep sense of morality and conscience is born here; one much deeper than a mere superego that was imposed from without at the Manipura level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is at the Anahata that we see the first manifestations of dharma or psycho-spiritual movement, the movement of the mind toward the spirit. The sense of self abstracted from the senses and extroverted will can more freely pursue the inner life and seek higher meaning. It can understand the way the Tao or the moral order of the universe functions so as to conform the individual will with that cosmic will. The mind begins to understand that it is only through becoming a responsible, conscious, and whole person that there can be any real meaning in life. The life lived only through the senses and passions and superficial form is now seen as a great bondage that can never bring any deep fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, the Anahata is only the beginning of self-transcendence. There is the abstracted feeling of the “I” that is ultimately independent of all objective qualities but the identity is still bound and mediated by subtle mental concepts defining the nature of self. There is not yet the undifferentiated and pure expression of the eternal I- feeling unmediated by the self-referential concepts of the Aham. Although there is a great degree of the pure I-feeling present the mind still uses concepts to refer itself to the objective experiences that it is attached to (the memories, personal history or self-narrative, self-defining characteristics, intellectual and emotional qualities, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be said that the Anahata Vortex is the occupation of the mind with the “I.” The ego or Aham is not necessarily seeking to indulge in its limited self, but seek its origin in the I-feeling. The problem comes about when this fascination with the nature of ones consciousness is projected into one’s finite self-concept. All of the growth energy of self discovery instead goes into some form of egotism. Vanity, narcissism, selfishness, and hypocrisy are the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half the 12 vrttis of the Anahata are “positive,” growth promoting vrttis and the other half are “negative” or at most neutral, self-justifying defense tendencies that perpetuate the ego’s limited boundaries instead of expanding and refining them. There is still a limited and bounded sense of self, but with the potential to discriminate between vice and virtue. There is also still the boundary of self and not self to be overcome, although not as marked as in the Manipura and Svadhistana. Harmony, balance, and proportion are key elements in this fulcrum that is the Anahata to help determine what is growth-promoting and virtuous (self, or good for the self) and what is vice, or inappropriate for spiritual self-growth (not self).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Anahata there appear to be two hexagons. Really, there is one. They seem different because one moves clockwise or centrifugally, and the other moves counter-clockwise or centripetally. Here we can see the fundamental yin-yang or centrifugal-centripetal interplay of the universe at work within the human mind. Together these forces combine to make the Anahata Vortex. These are 12 points at which the balance and imbalances of the human consciousness may express themselves in a refined way. When there is perfect balance and there is no escape through any vortex or vrtti in the 12 vertices, Shiva (Hunab Ku) always enters the human mind through the spiritual heart with its neutral force of consciousness or citishakti. Citishakti is the Consciousness that controls Shakti, creative energy because this divine creative energy has its essence in Shiva, or Consciousness. Shiva and Shakti are like fire and its capacity to burn; they are completely and eternally inseparable. All creation in this universe is due to the activity of Shakti and the conscious base of Shiva that silently witnesses the play of creation while at the same time offering its being as the essence on which Shakti may create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right side of the Anahata is dominated by the solar or centrifugal energy of Shakti. The left side of the Anahata is lunar or centripetal Shakti. The centrifugal force under the control of the witnessing entity of Shiva becomes the Son, the primordial creative expression of the Supreme Consciousness within the human and personal medium. It is for this reason that the Vedantic sages meditated on the right side of the spiritual heart, the nexus of where the super-personal Atman “touches” the personal and human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The left side of the Anahata is the “Mother of God”, the centripetal energy of Shakti that always brings the expressions of the Son (the centrifugal movement of creation) back to the neutral force of Shiva-Consciousness. The centripetal force never lets the centrifugal force become entirely lost into manifold expression and always brings it back to center. Together, in balance, these binary forces of creation manifest in the human being to the grade that there is a balance in the 12 vortices or vrttis at the 12 vertices of the 2 hexagons. When there is less duplicity, arrogance, vanity, and selfishness(negative vrttis), and more love, discernment and faith (positive vrttis), then the process of the unification of the microcosmic consciousness into the Macrocosmic Consciousness of Shiva is well under way. It is here in the spiritual heart of Anahata that the nameless, transcendental godhead may evolve a name for itself, for us, within each of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-dynamics-of-ka-and-kha-through-hope-and-worry&quot;&gt;The Dynamics of “Ka” and “Kha” through Hope and Worry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vrttis or vortexes of the microcosmic mind are subtle sounds that
result from the tension of internal and external mental movements. They
are evolutionary efforts to guide and direct the microcosm in its march
towards union with the macrocosm through yoga. These sounds are subtle
in that they are vibrations created from tensions in the psychic, non-
material realm. They are heard through deep concentration. According to
tantra, are the 50 fundamental mental vibrations of the human mind that
when spoken audibly form the Sanskrit alphabet. Vowel sounds are causal
and unmanifested ideas in the Macrocosmic Mind. They are beyond time
and space. Consonant sounds are effects of the causal mind that control
the manifestation of more tangible tendencies of the microcosmic mind.
This is the reason that in tantric meditation much importance is given to
the use of mantras which are intelligently organized from these
fundamental sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sound “ka” is the first sound at the 12 petaled lotus of Anahata
Vortex. “Ka” is the first consonant to break out of the causal sound matrix,
or logos, of Shiva. With this sound vibrates the great idea of hope, that
everything created comes from bliss. At the anahata level of consciousness
we are so aware of ourselves and our world. It is important that our lives be
meaningful and useful and move in a spiritual direction. True hope is the
practical knowledge of “I am That”. The eternal I-Witness, the Atman,
sustains and guides my every movement. It is knowledge that everything
that comes my way, comes from Shiva. Eventually this pure movement
of “ka” weakens and is distorted, then we put our hope in relative issues, in
our petty ego, in religion, politics, or the like. Hope is divided by worry,
doubt, and fear that our meaningful reality structure will not endure. Worry
is the second vrtti of the Anahata Vortex and will always counterbalance
hope until hope is honed into a pure and unwavering Self-confidence.
Together, these two vrttis represent the fundamental duality of modern
human consciousness. Hope is “ka”, and worry is “kha”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental lunar, centripetal, and introverted sound of “ha”
descends to ka, thus making “kha”. The lost mental movement that has
dissipated into false hopes is brought back to center with the addition of
“ha” to “ka”. “Ha” has the capacity in and of itself to bring any errant
microcosmic movement back into balance. “Ha” controls the internal,
centripetal movement of the mind. It is an aspirant, exactly between the
end of the vowels and the beginning of the consonants and thus functions
as a mediator between the visible and invisible, the causal and the
manifested effect. The following vrttis that continue to unfold reflect this
dual movement of an externally-moving consonant paired with the
internally-moving “ha” to balance that consonant’s movement when it
weakens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function of the microcosmic mind is always the medium between
the inner identity and its outer world, be it a physical, mental, or spiritual
worlds. The Manipura (3rd vortex at the navel), with its craving and blind
attachment, attempts to will desired things into being. With the qualities of
the Anahata previously described one would expect to find a vrtti that helps
bring an inner desire into being in a more discerning and less impulsive
manner. Hope is the inner belief that what one truly and deeply needs will
manifest itself into being. With the purest hope there is no manipulation by
the will to bring the event about, but the self rather relies on the power of
belief and faith to bring wish into reality. So the medium of the activity of
this vrtti (as well as others in the Anahata) is neither through the sensory
and motor organs nor the imposition of will, but through the eminence of
intuitive thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course people often hope for selfish and trivial things due to the pull
of the Manipura vrttis on the Anahata, but the propensity of hope
potentially has the sublime function of giving one an inner sense of
knowing, despite any lack of empirical, sensory experience. When the
Anahata is purified it has the capacity to understand the meaning and ideal
of form in the deepest sense. When the heart is pure one can intuit the
underlying meaning of a given situation. Here one’s own elevated thinking
can apprehend the subtle, cosmic intentions that are being thought into
being by the Cosmic Mind. An inner sense of certainty ensues from this
along with the belief that goodness will somehow come to fruition, despite
the limitations of the personal will to force it into being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power of faith or hope is one of the most profound capacities of the
human mind. The reason that faith has been so highly regarded as a great
virtue by all of the so-called higher religions is that it places the power of
will into a force higher than the individual will and egocentric authorship. It
thereby helps to bring about the realization that the cosmic will is supreme
and gives one even greater faith in the benevolence of the cosmic moral
order. This inner, intuitive certainty further inspires one to transcend the
turmoil and incessant anxiety of a self separated from Shiva, the
Supreme Self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While hope gives one the secure conviction that their own welfare is
dear to Shiva and thereby relieves the perpetual burden of a fearful,
limited self having to pine and struggle to assert its identity by coercing
and shaping the objective world to its will, worry is exactly the opposite.
When one is worried or excessively concerned over an event or an inner
ability there is a lack of faith or hope that things will turn out for the good.
The outside pressures or the internal inadequacies seem to be the causal
factors regulating life instead of a hidden, intelligent order. And because of
this concern over the preponderance of outside circumstances and a lack of
inner strength and confidence, the fretful ego may resort to its habitual
methods of asserting itself. Instead of a reliance on dharma or Tao to bring
things into fruition the worried and separated ego reverts to using its own
isolated will, mundane intellect and Sensory Mind. Instead of the ego
relying on the guidance of the quiescent eternal “I” or conscience, it uses
its own mental projections of the objective mind to fulfill its own end.
Here the fulcrum has shifted toward the negative pole. The pressures
and strains of a more complex consciousness aren’t directed to one’s own
higher intelligence and therefore the higher mechanisms (hope,
discrimination or rational judgment) aren’t used to cope with the
contradictions and limitations of the separate self. Instead the ego may
lean on its old habitual behavior patterns to deal with the more complex
struggles that a higher consciousness must bear. Here we have the
misplaced situation of a mind capable of deep and abstract thought but
only using those deep and idealistic thought processes to think about the
difficulties of a situation while the activity used to solve the issue come
from a lower, previous levels of awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paradigm is exactly the issue plaguing the present level of human
evolution. The upper end of the bell-curve of human consciousness is in-
between the stages of the Manipura and the Anahata levels of
development. Although there is a great degree of this new-found self-
awareness and rational intelligence, it doesn’t yet understand its own true
significance (as well as that of others) and how to apply this knowledge to
the world at large. How else can one explain how intelligent and relatively
civilized people use their shrewdness and technological understanding to
ruthlessly exploit nature, manipulate economic forces at home and abroad,
and wage war over oil? This leap in awareness at the Anahata is certainly
the saving grace of humanity but if that awareness doesn’t incorporate and
integrate the previous mental structures (the Manipura and Svadhistana),
then all sorts of complex mental issues arise, such as duplicity, selfishness
and repression. This will be a common theme throughout the Anahata
Vortex: whether one uses one’s higher intelligence to continue developing
psychologically and spiritually or whether this greater development of
consciousness and intelligence simply becomes a tool to exacerbate,
exploit and perpetuate the impulsive vrttis (craving, blind attachment,
sadism, etc.) of the Manipura.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-dynamics-of-ga-and-gha-through-expansion-and-love&quot;&gt;The Dynamics of “Ga” and “Gha” through Expansion and Love&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spiritual heart is the Anahata Vortex. Anahata means “not holding.”
It is the intuitive level of mind that begins to understand that there is an
infinite vastness and dignity inside itself and can begin to let go of blind
attachments caused by an underlying sense of fear and insecurity.
The intuitive mind of Anahata vibrates in tune with the Aerial Factor, a
very fine form of matter or prana that manifests its intentions toward form,
yet being beyond form itself. When completely purified this prana no
longer needs to vibrate with the vrttis or vortexes of the mind. The breath
stops completely. One is empty of form, but full of bliss. One hears the
inner logos of Shiva, all the sounds that make up Om, and sees how fine
vibrations of prana manifest the entire material universe. These rhythmic
vibrations or “strings” or pulses of prana stem from the “root” sounds of the
Causal Mind, the logos of Shiva. One day the human genius will be able
to map and even quantify these fine vibrations that make up the so-called
“quantum void.” Then, human beings will begin to understand the secrets
of the dimensions between mind and matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until this placation of the spiritual heart, the vrttis of the Anahata will
continue to guide and develop our awareness toward this understanding.
These fine sounds of the vrttis will vibrate the mind and attempt to
regulate the endocrine and nervous systems so that they can develop
higher functions. The 3rd and 4th vortexes of the Anahata Vortex are
controlled by the sounds “ga” and “gha.” “Ga” manifests a tendency
towards self-expansion and development of latent qualities, and “gha”
manifests a tendency toward deep, human affection, or love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the manifestation of the vrtti of expansion, the mind’s
“endeavor” is really expansion of the ego based on conquests of physical
space and material or acquisitions psychic meaning for the separate,
fearful, ego-dominated personality. This is the world of action and reaction.
The separate ego is always trying to find meaning and security to
compensate for its isolation and fear. One tries to fit into the social and
economic systems with ready-made patterns. These patterns most often do
not harmonize with the cosmological order and we suffer reactions
accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the vrtti of endeavor at the Anahata the latent qualities of the
Macrocosmic Mind, the repository of infinite, omniscient knowledge, can
begin to manifest themselves. New qualities, interests and subtle desires
begin to manifest in the personality. It is a psychic instinct that directs us
toward greater meaning at the intuitive level of mind. Where did your
spiritual and creative desires come from and when exactly did they start?
What hidden force directed you toward certain people, certain places,
books, or practices that opened up your inner spiritual life? At the intuitive
level of mind we begin to realize that there is an inner vastness that is
really living our lives and really knows how to do it. One only has to
convince the separate ego to go along with this flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Gha”, the vibration that regulates affection, is the counter-balance of
endeavor, or “ga.” Knowledge via expansion of the mind is useful to solve
existential problems and it is imperative that this knowledge be developed
in all spheres of existence- physical, social, psychological and spiritual.
However, no form of knowledge is complete without love, without a greater
human purpose for this knowledge. At the anahata level, reason and
affection aren’t yet separated. Head and heart are one. And it is possible
that all of the finer human qualities and intelligence may serve us not in an
accelerated collective destruction, but toward universal love and justice. It
is only when the warmth of deep human love is missing that the mind
becomes a rogue mind that constantly devours itself and others and keeps
itself forever separate from the intuitive order of existence. Spiritual
knowledge without the development of the finer, loving qualities of the
personality is an impossibility. This level of love is not yet universal
compassion because there are still finer needs of personal significance.
However, the development of these higher emotive functions eventually
lead one toward universal love or compassion, a quality of the Vishuddha
(5th) vortex, an even higher level of human consciousness. Here, one is so
close to the Atman that there remain few, if any, personal needs and one
only loves without any expectation or desire of reciprocation. When
Anahata is purified it becomes a direct conduit for the Causal Mind of
Vishuddha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Endeavor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Endeavor is the effort to unfold enfolded or dormant qualities of the
personality. We see that with the Anahata that there is the ability to think
in a very deep and meaningful way. With this sublime ability the mind can
probe into the deepest grounds of thought potential to discover and create
new modes of being for itself that further the expansion of human potential
and knowledge of existence. At the Manipura (3rd vortex) there was still the
impulsive hunger for expanding the mind in relation to its external
conceptual world. With the vrtti of endeavor the mind can expand itself not
merely by assimilating more of its outer environment, but by finding inner,
intuitive qualities that broaden and enlighten the concept of self. Endeavor
is the effort to discover who we really are on the inside. Now that there is a
greater degree of Mahat (self-reflecting awareness, “I exist”) and therefore
intuition, with a corresponding decrease in the externalized intellect, the
mind begins to question what the “I” truly is. At this stage the personality
is very well aware of the limited ego-driven tendencies and seeks to know
the reality and identity behind these limitations. And it is only when the
limited ego is frustrated with its external expansion and clearly sees its own
bondages that the desire to realize its inner and fuller potential is aroused.
Here one truly sees the life of incessant self-concern, ambition, and
attachment as the illusion of Self. With the manifestation of Mahat or “I-
feeling” and intuition one can look down upon the fray and ask “who is it
that sees all of this?” There is a calm, quiescent eye in the storm of the
self and one begins to desire what it is and how to attain it. Endeavor is
quite simply the desire for the understanding of Tao, of dharma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this movement is endeavor to realize and not realization itself.
The ego here assumes the qualities and identity necessary to live in
accordance with a deeper understanding and experience of existence. It is
not ensconsement and establishment in the intuitive life but the movement
toward that. Instead of the ego having an image of itself in accordance
with its external desires, it now manifests the qualities that help in its
psycho-spiritual orientation. Such qualities are necessarily ones that help
to understand, accept, and integrate the lower propensities into a more
refined self-concept. Such qualities are an acute awareness, non-judgment
of self and others, acceptance, compassion, moral conscience and an
adamant resolve to bring these qualities into expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While discussing this growth of self it is necessary to mention the 3 laws
that regulate the unfolding of higher propensities to incorporate and
compensate for the lower. These laws are recapitulation, transmutation,
and integration. It is clearly seen now how successive levels of
development grow through previous levels and that the vrttis at higher
vortexes are a similar though more refined expression of the lower vrttis.
The vrttis recapitulate themselves in successively higher modus operandi.
The mind isn’t entering entirely new form as it evolves to higher levels;
things are just restated in a more subtle way. For example, endeavor isn’t
impulsive like its predecessor, craving (at the Manipura), but both have to
do with mental expansion. Due to the fact that there are higher, more
conscious tendencies that correspond to more subtle levels of existence,
there is by necessity a transmutation of the energy used in the expression
of the lower as it moves toward the higher. Endeavor requires patience and
deep awareness, not forced and willful activity as in craving. Vrttis are
ingrained tendencies, mental instincts, that have evolved to serve an
evolutionary purpose and so there isn’t a rapid, immediate transition from
the old to the new. The new has to be born into being and the old will
continue to assert itself. This evolutionary shift in mental expression
therefore requires tremendous energy conversion. This process happens
unconsciously through an innate and expansive guiding faculty as well as
through the will and choice. One can decide to move along and follow one’s
inner voice that is leading the transmutation. If not, then there is always
trouble. A factor necessary for the successful transmutation of the higher
frequency of mental energy is integration. The old must be incorporated
into the new. That old expression of energy must be entirely directed into
the new faculty; otherwise the mind will be split in that there are now
opposing expressions of mind. This split may either to duplicity, a
regression to previous modes of behavior or a repression of the lower by
the higher. To use our previous example, the spiritually oriented personality
propelled by the endeavor vrtti may repress his ambitious tendencies from
his conscious awareness, but these old ambitious and willful tendencies still
have an energetic momentum to assert themselves unconsciously. He may
therefore express duplicity or hypocrisy by saying one thing and
unconsciously doing another. A similar psychological dissociation of the
lower from the higher was mentioned while discussing worry and will be
dealt with more when discussing the vrttis of vanity, selfishness, duplicity,
and argumentativeness as these tendencies reveal an incomplete
integration of lower vrttis into the self-reflective, intuitive, and
magnanimous potentialities of the Anahata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dissociation of the newly emerging tendencies from the old,
ingrained behavior patterns produces what classical psychology has termed
the shadow. The shadow doesn’t reside in one particular kosa, in other
words it is not a layer of mind. It is a defaulted mechanism of integration
from one mental-emotive level to the next. Whatever is not accepted and
integrated and therefore either repressed or suppressed is relegated into
the shadowy category of the “not me.” For example, if the mind doesn’t
have the vigor to make the jump from the Svadhistana (2 nd vortex) to the
Manipura (3rd vortex), then the entropic vrttis of the Svadhistana become
the shadow for the vigorous and ambitious mind that is trying to function at
the Manipura level. The entropy of the Svadhistana vrttis will complicate
and confound the autocratic Manipura vrttis. The externally driven
personality may suppress his/her tendencies that are associated with
insecurity and lack of confidence. In a similar manner, if the jump to the
Anahata from Manipura is not complete, as in our previous example, then
the vrttis or cluster of vrttis that constituted the former personality at the
Manipura become the shadow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affection&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The affection of one sentient being for another as expressed through
this tendency at the Anahata is not one of an intense desire to consume
and possess another solely to gratify one’s own appetites. The quality of
interpersonal dialogue at the Anahata is a mutual, inter-subjective regard.
There is a love based on the deeply human qualities of another. It is not
completely selfless, however. Here there is still a desire to hold onto the
qualities of another because of the deep meaning (artha) that is given. This
form of attachment isn’t to satiate one’s hunger for external expansion but
is a fondness for the other based on the way that others affect them in a
deep and soulful way. With affection one’s heart is touched by another. The
inner qualities of another are loved by means of the deeper qualities of the
one who loves. In this dialogue the one who is loved is regarded for who
they really are on the inside and the lover exercises and discovers more of
his/her deeply human affective capacities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human love, whether intimate and romantic, familial, or brotherly has
such a tremendous hold over us that it both liberates our hearts from self-
enclosure while at the same time holds us only to those that we personally
love. Affection must be perfectly balanced in order to bring happiness,
otherwise it breeds suffering. It brings happiness when the regard we have
for others supersedes our own selfish wants and demands and thereby
propels us beyond self-interest. Affection always leads to obstacles when it
is exploited. This is done by placing the importance of the personal
meaning that it gives us and the demand to keep receiving it over the true
needs of others. In the words of William Blake, “Love seeketh not itself to
please, nor for itself hath any care. It gladly gives itself with ease and
creates a heaven in hell’s despair.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many love only to receive love and recognition from others without
giving much themselves. Only when affection reaches a functional synergy
or symbiosis where both the lover and the loved interchange roles freely,
both harmoniously giving and receiving, that a person can truly begin to
realize the higher function of love. Human love in all of its forms is an
intimation, an emerging expression of divine love. Love is the only seed of
spirituality. One who is loved feels worthy and whole, regarded and
respected. The one who loves sees the power of transformation upon
another by and from their own emotive forces within.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the person feels love-worthy by others a noble confidence and self-
respect, or respectful Self awareness is gained that permits one to love
freely, without fear, selfish demands and an imposing personal need. And
are not fear, selfishness, and our personal demands and insistence the
tendencies that reflect a lack of true confidence, Self awareness and self-
respect, and therefore, a lack of love? Only a strong and integrated mind
can truly love. At this level of personal integration one understands how
love is the essential element, the magic elixir for the growth of soul that
cures all of the fear, selfishness, and suffering in life. One sees how oneself
has been transformed by it and cant help but want to share it with others.
This is the culmination of personal love: to love without strings attached
and not to expect anything in return. Love ceases to be a mere feeling or
personal need but rather a spiritual principle with the deepest meaning and
power. When this stage is reached an even deeper and universal spiritual
love can begin to emerge. This more exalted tendency is at the Vishuddha
(5th vortex). Love and affection begins at the Anahata but reaches its fullest
expression at the Vishuddha. Here affection as artha (personal meaning) is
fully transformed into dharma (universal and essential meaning). In the
end there is but one Friend, in many colors and in many places, who moves
through infinite love behind all our faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vanity-and-na&quot;&gt;Vanity and “na”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The order of the vortexes or vrttis of the microcosmic mind moves
from the subtle to the gross, or internal toward the external. The order of
the Sanskrit alphabet moves from the deeper vowels in the throat toward
sounds gradually made more forward in the mouth; from the guttural
toward the labial sounds. The alphabet, like the order of vrttis, starts with
the vowel sounds that are eternal and beyond time, and continuing with the
succession of consonants that move within time. “A” for example, can
sound constantly, without pulsation or pauses by the tounge, whereas a
consonant like “ga” or “ca” requires pauses and repetitions of the tongue.
Pulsation is the mark of time, the “mental measurement of the motivity of
action.” This is a very interesting example of how the internal, intuitive
macrocosmic order is mimicked and repeated in the physical body of the
microcosm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These sound vortexes or matrices or “strings” are adaptations for the
mind to act according to various layers of density. They vibrate on certain
elemental planes whose end expression is always the manipulation of
matter via the physical body. These vortexes break through from these
higher energetic planes, explode in the microcosmic mind, and cause a
corresponding explosion in the body by moving the brain to fire off
hormones and neurotransmitters. Each sound vortex has its unique
purpose and function. From a spiritual perspective, we can categorize them
as pro-matter or pro-spirit. A vortex that is pro-matter will lock the mind
into the physical body with cruder thoughts and lower passions. Mental
energy is transmuted into physical expression. A pro-spirit vortex balances
the body chemistry in such a way that the mind and body are placid and
calm and capable of conceiving and feeling the workings of heaven, the
subtle planes of existence. This allows that the mind metamorphoses itself
finally into the original substance of Consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Anahata Vortex is a balance of these inner and outer tendencies.
Half are “positive” and half are “negative”, or pro-spiritual and pro-
material. The negative tendencies lock the mind and body into egocentric
patterns of thinking and feeling. The lower nature is still not convinced of
its truer purpose in existence and still maintains and defends its separation,
its vanity. The positive tendencies take the sincere aspiring personality into
deeper levels of humanistic and eventually spiritual thinking and feeling.
The fifth vrtti of the Anahata Vortex vibrates with the sound “na”,
the guttural “na.” The various “n” sounds, the gutteral, the palatal, the
cerebral, and the dental “na” sounds are not paired with a “ha” sound, like
the consonants. They don’t go out, so to speak, and don’t need the
centripetal “ha” to bring it back. Instead, all of the “na” sounds refer to
certain generalized egocentric states of mind that generate from the
nucleus of the ego that is determined by and constituted of the rest of the
dual natured vortexes. To understand this point, the fifth vrtti of anahata,
the guttural “na”, controls the expression of self-regard, which is always to
varying degree an expression of self-love. When the expression is refined
and confident, it is a form of self-respect. When the person lacks
confidence, then it always tends toward vanity. Instead of being
expressions with a counter-balance like the other consonants, the “na”
sounds are more like generalized states or attitudes of the ego. The other
“na” sounds are also purely egocentric states of being like hypocrisy,
jealousy, and ambition, which correspond to the palatal, cerebral and
dental “na” sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The repetitions of 4 consonants follwed by “na” continue throughout the
Anahata Vortex and down into the manipura (3rd vortex). This creates a
pattern of 1-2-3-4-”n”eutral-1234-”n”eutral…and so on. The rhythm
merges back into the “n”ucleus, and from the nucleus receives a new
impulse. This can also be described as a rhythm of centripetal centrifugal,
centripetal, centrifugal, neutral and so on. The ideas of the sounds of the
vrttis vibrating at certain tones with certain rhythmic patterns give scope
for deep speculation and investigation into the fundamental “music” of the
universe and how perhaps our human aesthetics may mirror this
fundamental, harmonious order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is now clear that the mind and personality affected by the propensities
of the Anahata Vortex are deeply self-conscious, ideational tendencies that
lead the person to a more abstract but congruent self-concept. The self-
concept at the anahata level isn’t so much defined by the physical body, its
urges, and the grosser elements of its environment. The mind and
personality is abstracted from these levels and its focus is more mental and
ideational. The personality is informed by the deep and abstracted
thoughts of “who am I essentially, unconditioned by my environment?”, or
“what do I truly feel.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vanity represents the self-centered triumph of the individual over the
outward pull of the social environment. The social environment demands
conformity and a submission of the self to the collective. The process of
individuation, contrarily, is the discovery of the true identity of the person.
This represents the endeavor of the individual to overcome the fear of its
own social alienation as well as the social censorship for moving away from
the dominant social paradigms that have conditioned the emerging,
evolving self into limited self-concepts and narrow social boundaries. This
process is natural and healthy in the evolution of mind back toward Spirit; it
seeks the unbounded knowledge, being and bliss of its essential,
unconditioned, and uncreated essence. Vanity, however, represents the
incomplete and partial process of individuation. Vanity looks back on its
growth and achievements out the entropic pull of conformity, insecurity,
shame and weakness with a sense of self-satisfaction and proud
accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of finding its grounding in pure Spirit or in its dynamic
relationship to Spirit, the ego secures a niche for itself in its own qualities,
abilities, achievements, and self-referential words and symbols. In other
words, the ego proudly identifies only with the objective, relative, and ever-
changing qualities that color and qualify the pure feeling of I instead of the
“pure and eternal I” itself. However, vanity does not imply the bounded
identity of the ego with its own qualities. Qualification and bondage of the I
doesn’t necessarily mean pride and vanity. Instead, vanity is the
aggrandizement and exclusive identification of the ego with its own
qualities. The process of the whole evolving through the part, or the
Macrocosm becoming through the microcosm, is ignored. The ego sees its
objective qualities and proud accomplishments as its subjectivity, as its
fundamental identity. It is more than the confusion of the subject with the
object however, as the sense of doership (ego or Aham) is alienated and
encapsulated from the rest of the mental being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the ego doesn’t recognize its full mental, psychological makeup
and gives no regard to the subtle evolutionary forces trying to express and
manifest themselves through the individual. The individual instead sees its
own ego as the origin and be all and end all of existence, “I am the center
of the universe”. The true self is pure, unconditioned, and free. Shakti’s
gunas generate all of the qualities for that Subject. With vanity there is the
confusion of the subject with objective qualities. The I qualified and
intermingling by objective qualities is mistaken as the hub of the identity.
There is no wonder that vanity and pride are universally considered the
greatest error and flaw possible for humans. The Macrocosmic process of
evolution and becoming through the microcosm is usurped by the limited
ego with its claim to the authorship of this process.
A fact that many people don’t realize is that vanity is a weakness. Its
easy for one to mistaken see how accomplished people with vanity are
actually strong and fearless people. However, if one looks deeper into the
dynamics and origins of vanity one will clearly understand that vanity is a
compensation for uncertainty and fear and a home for ambition and
compulsion. In other words vanity represents the qualification of a more
intelligent and conscious mind by the unresolved complexes associated
with the vrttis of the svadhistana(2nd vortex) and manipura (3rd vortex)
propensities. The conflict of the doubt, shame, and fear with the ambition,
blind attachment, and lust for achievement on the battleground of the
manipura seeks a shelter in a higher and intelligent form of awareness at
the anahata. Vanity aids in the compensation and assuagement of this
conflict by putting one’s psychic energy into higher qualities and
components of the self. A more abstract notion of self-recognition emerges
as the glory of the internal ego with its self-reflective ideas of itself are
embellished. Here the identification with one’s own psyche becomes the
channel for the psychic energy or the momentum and inspiration of the
mind. The ego may still qualify itself with its external achievements, but it
is the internalization of these achievements by an abstracted identity
separated from its environment that gets the focus of awareness.
The liberation of the identity from the body and environment is the
summum bonum of human life if the process is carried through to
completion without creating separation. Most of us are somewhere in-
between; realizing that we have a transcendent identity separated from
world and body but are still contradictorily associating this abstract notion
of “I” with the objective qualities of world and body, and are therefore
bound to the imaginary notions of “me and mine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-dynamic-of-ca-and-cha-in-discernment-and-depression&quot;&gt;The Dynamic of “Ca” and “Cha” in Discernment and Depression&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the phase of involution, Shiva, the infinite consciousness, has been
transformed by his immortal consort Shakti, the divine creative energy, into
all that is in this universe. It is Shiva itself that has become “star stuff.”
The microcosm is a creation made on the return journey, where star-
light and matter are yearning to evolve beyond physicality, into pure
energy, into mind, and finally back again into Consciousness. Therefore,
the microcosmic mind is fundamentally dominated by the centripetal,
return, or evolutionary force. “Ha” is the sound of this primordial
centripetal energy of mind. It is the first vrtti, or vortex of the mind, which
is pure subjective awareness. “Ha” pertains to the Ajina Vortex. Here the
mind misteriously conceives only the inconceivable Atman who is entirely
beyond the mind itself. The mind “conceives” this truth in understanding
that “I am That”; “I am Consciousness itself, and not this mind.” It is the
only tendency of mind that goes entirely into transcendence, into the pure
subjectivity of Shiva. Even the noble Vishuddha tendencies relate to the
external world in a spirit of service and chivalry, but “Ha” is a force of mind,
of Shakti, that surrenders itself only to Shiva. Its comforting to know that it
is the only force that can entirely dominate the mind and unify it in the
infinite abode of Shiva. The universe conspires against our external
desires. It is only here that all desires find their fulfillment. All of the other
49 major vrttis go outward. “Ha” is the only tendency that psorax can’t
touch. The very existence of the parasite who feeds on unconsciousness
depends on your not going back to the One, of your inability to transmute
your little “I”, the ego, into the great “I-Witness.” Therefore, only
surrendering to the infinite Atman will bring an end to psorax’s dominion.
Only the entity who stands beyond good and evil can liberate one from
good and evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While incarnated in human form and passing through the soul-building
experiences of this world we must know and cultivate the positive
propensities of mind that help us to expand and adapt to this relative world
while never forgetting that our true home is in the spirit. We must discern
between the relative and the absolute, between finite and infinite. The
world isn’t inherently corrupt, we just haven’t properly learned how to
handle ourselves. We haven’t learned to economize the infinite nature of
desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discernment is the sixth propensity of the Anahata Vortex. It is
administrated by the sound “ca.” Discernment is conscience, the force of
Consciousness over the mind. Mind harmonizes with the sublime,
transcendental consciousness and lives and acts according to its inner way.
The inner path can only become pure when we really know the difference
between what liberates us and what does not- that which causes suffering
and delusion. Desire is tamed only through the realization that it always
brings some form of suffering in the end. The only desire that truly
liberates is the desire to become one with the Infinite. It is only when a soul
has struggled and wrestled and developed its discernment that the
instinctual nature of external desires begin to lose their grip on the mind.
The finite can never satiate the infinite. External desires can never bring
nirvana. Striving after this liberation doesn’t mean giving up the world
entirely, but a seeker must have the eyes open so as to properly navigate
through maya. With the development of discernment, temptations may
come more to test you, but finally help to establish one in a deeper
understanding in which renunciation truly becomes sweet and not
something forced and manipulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not understanding this essential truth of existence always brings
emptiness, existential ennui. This is the 7th vrtti of the Anahata Vortex,
psychic depression, controlled by the sound “cha.” “Ha” must descend to
“ca” to return the undiscerning mind back into equilibrium. Hopefully, a
little “dark night of the soul” will do the trick, but many fall so deep into
emptiness and accept all that psorax is offering. Psorax loves an empty,
bored ego and will always find ways to fill you. “An idle mind is the devil’s
workshop.” The greater the image that one invests in the separate ego the
greater the shadow cast upon the mind by the infinite radiance of
consciousness. We don’t understand that it is our own shadow cast by an
inflated vain image that traps us in this maya. If there is a place for an
image in this eternal mind storm of vrttis, then I imagine that is should be
as light, honest and transparent as possible. The dark schemes of the
unconscious ego can’t hide too well in this discerning light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discernment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned the Anahata level of mind is the fulcrum on
which rests the directional flow of mind. If the Svadhistana and Manipura
propensities qualify the Anahata propensities one may get an intellectually
developed mind with a definite and abstract sense of separateness lacking
warmth and moral conscience. This aloof coolness is due to the fact that
the intellect and abstract, self-concept is still preoccupied with the self-
establishing propensities of the Svadhistana Vortex and/or the self-
acquisitional propensities of the Manipura. The ability of a heightened
consciousness and personality with a potentially deep, inner life and
capacity to think and feel deeply is in this state unable to use this
consciousness to relate with others in correspondingly deeper ways. The
drives of the lower vrttis usurp the intelligence of the higher.
The propensity of conscience or discernment informs the mind with the
ability to use its reason to determine what choices and modes of being lead
toward the growth and expansion of the inner life in relation to Spirit as well
as world. It can also discern what actions lead toward the confinement of
self-centeredness and psychological stagnancy. With conscience the mind
can understand its potential for self-centeredness while at the same time be
in touch with the intuitive ideas that guide the mind out of its limitations
and towards spiritual realization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discernment, the ability to know what is good and just, is a propensity
that is rooted in the Intuitive Mind. Having a deep, intuitive ability to
understand and peer into the nature of the self and the world enables one
to act in accordance with truth. The intuitive conscience spoken of here is
the essential conscience, the conscience as Consciousness; it is the
representative of Spirit within the mind. Discernment, or viveka, is not the
external, conventionally imposed script of do’s and don’ts, but the inner
voice and benevolent guidance of the eternal Tao. The higher order of
harmony in the Tao, or Cosmic Mind, is intuitively understood by the Aham
at the Anahata. These subtle laws are translated into microcosmic
existence and harmonized with humane sentiment and discerning wisdom. .
The principles of Yama and Niyama serve as guidelines to develop this
natural, moral conscience that is guided by the Intuitive Mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depression&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 3 main degrees of depression that can be experienced. The
propensity of psychic stupor at the 2nd vortex is of course the heaviest. It
represents a crippling of the entire psychological foundation. With
melancholy at the 3rd vortex there is an entropy of the dynamic,
extroverted propensities that link the phenomenal self with its world. The
vrtti of emptiness at the fourth vortex is, as the name implies, a mental
depression in which the conscious ego experiences ennui, boredom, lack of
meaning, and dispiritedness. It is more of a psychic and existential malady
as opposed to a mere crippling of the drives and instincts that characterize
melancholy and psychic stupor.
The Aham, or ego, feels empty not just because the world is not in
harmony with the psyche but the psyche is not in harmony with itself. The
Anahata Vortex is concerned with the deep meaning of the phenomenal
identity, of what the true nature of the personality is. Psychic depression
results when these existential needs are not fulfilled or realized. There is
only an empty, inner space. Nothing connects and integrates the self
definition with itself as well as to other selves and society.
Essentially, this type of depression ensues when the ego is not in
harmony with its conscience, the deeply intuitive ideas that link all
elements of the personality together and give it inspiration and direction.
Conscience is the guiding spirit within mind. It shows us what is virtuous
and how to align ourselves with the spirit of benevolence or Dharma at any
given moment and in any situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flow and dynamics of mental life is not a chaos but a very refined
order. It is only when the ego resists this intuitive order that one can
become confused, alienated, enervated, and eventually depressed.
Depression, especially when experienced existentially at the Anahata, has
its own meaning and order. It is in fact a wake-up call to be more
conscious of what we are and how we should be. In many cases depression
manifests in periods of great transformation. “Before preparing a man for
great things, heaven first fills him full of bitterness and despair,” a Taoist
friend once said. Perhaps depression, at least when viewed spiritually, can
serve the purpose of making us more real, more aligned with our inner
selves. The duplicity and incongruities within the personality are
undermined and disabled from further perpetuation. So often the ego
invests itself in socially constructed and uncreative images, in a superficial
conformity to a conventional system, or just never explores or listens to its
own inner voice that is always calling for expansion and transformation.
Psychic depression can root out the subtle forms of egotism and vanity
in even the most spiritual of minds. St. John of the Cross termed this type
of dispiritedness the “Dark Night of the Soul.” It appears as a contraction
and dulling of the mental faculties but underneath there is a spiritual
process occurring that is helping a soul move beyond all of the limitations
and boundaries that keep it confined to its separateness and self-enclosure.
And with psychic depression there is the ability to ruminate over why one
feels heavy and lacks meaning, why things are just not going right, and to
thereby find solutions. Our inner lives are never haphazard and
meaningless. Life is a constant process of becoming. Each and every
situation is an opportunity for growth-to exercise our discriminative
intellect, insight and humane compassion. Within us always is conscience,
the voice of Spirit, incessantly guiding and directing our lives for our
greatest good. We need only to listen to and be true to ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-dynamics-of-ja-and-jha-in-self-and-selfishness&quot;&gt;The Dynamics of “Ja” and “Jha” in Self and Selfishness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the seventh vrtti of the spiritual heart, we move into the right, solar
side of the Anahata Vortex. Here the centrifugal force is stronger than the
centripetal force and the tendencies on this side move more outward than
inward. The seventh vrtti is the need for self-definition or “Aham vrtti”.
Aham is ego or “doer-I”. Aham really doesn’t denote egotism or selfishness,
which is in fact the eigth vrtti. I call Aham “self-definition” because it is
simply the need to understand yourself in the relative plane of existence;
who you are, who you have been and who you want to do in this life. It
cannot be a negative tendency because the human mind propelled by this
vrtti always desires clarity, expansion and betterment of its existential
position. In fact, this tendency can take one so deep into the question of
“who am I?” that the very separateness of the ego-dominated “I”
disappears into the eternal “I-Witness”. To follow this vrtti to its origin takes
one back to the headwaters of the godhead where it pours itself out into
every microcosmic soul. The Aham is the active, doer-I; but just behind it is
the I-witness that is perfectly still, eternal, and simple. Where does one
begin and the other end? It is just like trying to find the edge of a shadow in
that there is no real, defined limit. The ego in its most noble expression is
but a relative vehicle for the super-personal Consciousness to express itself
as a person, as a Self-realized human being. And it becomes so, or will
become so in every microcosm. When one truly trusts oneself, then the
person is sustained by the I-Witness itself. To simply remember and ideate
on the Witnessing Entity behind your person will always put the mind into
balance and all problems are placed in a clearer perspective. The person is
but an ornamentation, an unintentional flash whose image is illuminated
from an image-less act from deep within one’s inner Subjectivity. This
expression is controlled by the vibrant and buoyant acoustic root of “ja.”
The degeneration of this manifestation of the Macrocosm in the
microcosm is egotism or selfishness. It is controlled by the sound “jha.”
Here is where a temple to the separate, fearful and vain ego is built and
worshiped by the vrttis below the Anahata Vortex. The egocentric and vain
desires coupled by the unconscious emotional complexes take refuge in an
embellished image of oneself. Where selfishness reigns, death is not far
away. The underlying reason for our crisis of consciousness, culture and
self-definition is not just the natural limitations of evolving beings but the
enforcement of this vrtti by our society and its institutions. Instead of
fostering a sense of inter-being and cooperation, most of us have learned
individual separateness, competition and domination. Within a capitalist
and individualist society there is space for just a few “winners” while so
many suffer from a lack of personal fulfillment and social alienation that
leaves them spiritually estranged and neurotic. I was born in probably one
of the most neurotic and mentally ill societies on the planet, at least for the
so-called developed world. Now, in the north of Mexico, I see that most
people want to have a typical American life-style and that these
materialistic, individualistic values only further corrupt what is already quite
a troubled culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can carry this selfishness over into one’s spiritual practice as well
and selfishly seek enlightenment. One who truly knows the Atman also
loves from this sublime stance. I have seen many who devote long hours to
meditation and/or yoga but really make no progress because they think
only of themselves and their spiritual image. In fact, they create much
imbalance in their lives and fail to see how they only begin to suffer more
than when they were just mundane people. As an Upanishad states, “those
that seek only the finite go into darkness. Those who seek only the infinite
go into deeper darkness.” Yoga is the balance of adjusting the internal and
external mental flows and making them one. One really needs a fairly
balanced mind before beginning spiritual practice. Unfortunately, yoga, and
especially Tantra Yoga, is not a form of psychotherapy designed to cure
modern psychological complexes. Rather, it is a form of pinnacled, “apex
psychology” designed to help well-adjusted people attain spiritual
realization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those not so well-adjusted, a clear, psychological understanding of
yama and niyama coupled with gentle asanas and meditation is necessary
before attempting any other practices. If one looks at the world of yoga, it is
mostly an ego show and there are very few who really understand the
implications of what they are teaching. Many are just asana clowns, but it
gets even more dangerous the higher one goes up the ashtaunga (8-
limbed) ladder. I lived in a monastic community with many Tantra Yoga
practitioners. Although there were some very good examples of mature
meditators, there were also so many who were often quite neurotic because
they couldn’t digest all of the unconscious and sub-conscious psychic
content that their practices were awakening. Instead of finding
enlightenment, one only ends up deeper in the quagmire of an ignorant ego
besieged by so many emotional complexes. They probably would have been
better off with families and a less intense spiritual practice.
For the ego that contemplates and surrenders to the inner radiance of
pure awareness, selfishness becomes something aversive. Selfishness is
revelry in the ignorance of separateness. It is born of suffering and dies in
suffering. The individual who truly understands his/her inner self will always
contribute something good to the collective well-being. Through the
contemplation and devotion to the pure “I” beyond thought and volition,
one can’t help but find oneself in all persons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ego, Self-Identity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aham-vrtti does not refer to egotism or the vrtti of vanity. Instead, this
propensity is the feeling of one’s actual identity. It is the existential concept
of what one’s psychological make-up consists of, independent of inferiority
or superiority complexes, of what the essential nature of the personality is.
It informs one of what are the innate proclivities; one’s cognitive styles and
affective tones, whether one is introverted or extroverted, a thinker or a
feeler, analytical or intuitive, etc..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This self-concept is a notion of identity that organizes and structures the
various propensities and modes of thought into an organized concept of a
general identity. Ego vrtti gives a thought-form to the notion of “I”.
Although the “I” or Mahat is clearly manifest at the Anahata Vortex, it is
still qualified by phenomenal reality. The reality of the ego here is mental
and psycho-spiritual. Ego, therefore, is a concept of what the “I” is in
relation to the relative world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep and wondrous potentials are possible with this vrtti. The human
notion of the “I” is most often bound into sociological, national, cultural, and
regional as well as the limited notions of the lower personality. However, a
great potential resides in this vrtti in that the eternal spiritual identity,
Shiva, can find an abode of expression through the human personality.
There is truly only one Aham in the universe, and it belongs to the
Macrocosmic Mind. Only through association of the Macrocosmic Aham
with the microcosmic chitta does the Aham feel that it belongs to the
physical body and psychological identity. Maya, ultimately, is but a trick of
the senses and the Aham who identifies with their relative reality.
While it is true that the human personality is something relative as it is
within the domain of Shakti, there is, however, the reflection of the
fundamental consciousness that informs the notion of identity. At this stage
of the cultivation of the spiritual personality the objective qualities and
concepts that qualify the Identity are not so much a bondage but rather a
means of expression in which the ineffable Infinite Being expresses itself
through the finite personality. The objective qualities are transparent in
that the personality no longer clings to outer, conditioned notions for self-
reference. Here one understands that the infinite Shiva, in itself, is not a
personality with any qualities. It expresses itself through the finer, subtler
realms of the relative, created world. Personality or character cannot exist
for the Infinite without the limitations of finite definitions. Conversely,
personality cannot exist in the finite without the reflection of the subjective,
existential feeling of I, which is Infinite. Character, therefore, is the
breeding ground of the Infinite to express itself consciously through a finite
medium. Of course all of creation is the progeny of Shiva, but it is within
the developed human being that self-consciousness knows itself
fundamentally as Supreme Consciousness, even though there still may be
subtle qualifications of that Consciousness. But without those subtle
qualifications, the Infinite would not have a personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All human beings are gods in disguise. Only one who treads the deepest
ground of their being and identity realizes that their life, their being, and
relative existence is in truth a vehicle for Shiva to manifest itself in
multitudinous forms of personality. The infinite gives a name to the
nameless. This is perhaps the sweetest and melodious truth of human life:
that human life is verily the Life Divine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Egoism, Selfishness&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all of the vrttis of the Anahata Vortex are related to the concept of
self, half of them bind the identity to the limitations of self while the other
half, the positive qualities, provide an impetus for the expansion of the
phenomenal self. With vanity there is an embellishment and pride with the
qualities that one identifies with in an attempt to establish one’s existential
identity. The vrtti of selfishness is similar with its fixation on the qualities of
the limited identity. However, with this tendency there is even more of a
sharp and guarded egocentrism than with vanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vanity is a limitation, but at the same time gives one a sense of pride
and confidence with a belief in their self-efficacy. One can have a healthy
personality with good qualities but still hold onto a little pride. Selfishness
is more of a pathology in that the personality is lacking of true and
meaningful qualities and instead of endeavoring to expand in soulful and
meaningful ways, it fixes ones psychic energy exclusively on preserving the
notion of self. A proud person can at times step outside of their boundaries
and connect with others. This is more difficult for the selfish in that their
self-concern and importance is not just to polish off and refine the
personality. Rather it is a defense that helps to hold together the integrity
of a weak ego structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very often this vrtti is found to work in accordance with the vrttis of the
second vortex. Resentment, compulsion, repression (of the 2nd vortex) are
all propensities that hold together the integrity of the ego’s foundation. If
the ego isn’t well integrated and the 3rd and 4th vortex vrttis haven’t
integrated and compensated for the second vortex, then the 4th vortex
personality will be very contracted. The potential for psychic expansion at
the Anahata Vortex will be concentrated on the security of a fragile self-
concept that is perpetually insecure. The character of such a person is
often aloof, distrustful, and vacillates between a constrained emotional
detachment and a repression of infantile tendencies and a compulsion to
act upon them. One also maintains a very marked self-other boundary that
keeps others at a safe distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duplicity and “na”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there ever were a favorite hiding place for psorax in the human mind,
it must be in the vortex or vrtti of duplicity. Recall that psorax is the term
that Pluma Blanca referred to as the centripetal or return force in the
universe that always pushes back against and apparently punishes
microcosmic, outward actions that are not in harmony with the original,
balanced actions of the Macrocosm. This outward, frustrated projection
remains lodged in one’s mental and physical body in the form of a reaction
like a constant itch under the skin, or something much, much worse. Every
previous mental action still weighs and acts upon the mind in the present.
Only in the spiritually ignorant microcosmic mind is there a need for this act
of compensation to put the universe back into order after distorting it with
an impulsive will. Is psorax really evil? It just pretends to be the bad guy to
reflect our own shadow. Behind everything in this phenomenal world exists
an underlying love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With duplicity the mind has evolved what seems to be an efficient
mechanism of allowing 2 contrary systems to function side by side without
any contradiction, or so it seems. The “raging bundle of desire in a dying
animal” and the sincere, responsible, conscious human being incarnate in
the same being. Hermann Hesse’s Steppenwolf comes to mind here.
Duplicity acts as a form of repression and distortion of what really is true
about our lives in the more shadowy area while at the same time giving free
reign to the wolf inside without compunction or pangs of conscience. In
short, duplicity is a lie. It is an attempt to save face, to not admit that one is
governed by the shadow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shadow, and therefore psorax, is everywhere humans are; in
individuals and the collective. The grossest examples exist common society,
in our daily conventions, and especially religion and politics. The imperialist
governments create their own enemies or “terrorists”. They themselves
promote, manipulate or even create corrupt foreign regimes who prostitute
their natural resources and human labor to the powerful nations. They will
never hesitate to make the most absurd lies so as to wage war and kill
millions to steal the natural wealth from the rest of the world. The average
citizens go along with it and wave their flags and get fat while unwitting
soldiers and private security forces and other drones go off to other lands to
kill people and bring their “demonocracy” to all. Where does psorax fit into
all of this? What kind of shadow is created from an individual that believes
these lies and what kind of greater monster is created by a collective body
that goes along with the myth? Even greater and darker is the shadow of
the shrewd people that fabricate these false realities for their own benefit.
The reactions from these actions are all so apparent in the collective
depression, neurosis and zombification of the common people who have
little notion of or feel helpless to the false realities of their lives. A life
unconnected to the subterranean flow of unity consciousness will always be
compensated by cosmic law; the grosser the transgression, the grosser the
reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever the personality makes a jump from one kosa to the next there
is of necessity a shift of psychic energy as well as the objectives of that
psychic energy. A healthy evolutionary leap from one kosa to the next
would gradually incorporate the lower tendencies into the higher. As we
have seen there is a recapitulation of prior tendencies in successively
subtler forms. If the old patterns of expression is not transmuted and
integrated into the new, then a split within the personality occurs. The
lower tendencies exist and function at the same time as the higher. And
because there is a great difference in thematic structure at each mental
level, there are therefore very definite incongruities in such a personality.
What was once the major them of a particular vortex becomes the
unconscious shadow of the next higher vortex. For example, the
propensities of the 3rd vortex that were not incorporated into the Anahata
level of personality become the shadow for that personality.
The tendency of duplicity or hypocrisy manifests itself when the
Anahata-intelligence of the personality is unable to fully integrate the lower,
now unconscious propensities, of the vortexes preceding it. Instead of the
Anahata Vortex being able to transmute the psychic energy of the lower
propensities into one of its own, the mind at this level tries to mask, deny,
distort, or suppress these incongruent tendencies. Here we may have the
case of a personality endowed with some finer, conscious qualities and
intelligence; for example a little moral conscience, a warm affection for
others, as well as a spiritual outlook on life. This same personality,
however, still contains remnants of a previous pattern of mental functioning
that run contrary to the current sense of being. Instead of consciously
recognizing and working to integrate these disparate tendencies into a
harmonious and conscious synthesis the mind can use its cognitive abilities
to distort and mask these contrary tendencies and thereby permit them to
exist side by side with the conscious personality or ego. Different
environments will bring out these different, opposing tendencies. In one
environment one may behave in an uninhibited manner, expressing what is
normally unexpressed, while in another one may act according to social
protocol. What is meant here is not the expression of different facets of the
personality that actually accord to a current situation. Instead duplicity is
the act of covering up, putting up a show or “persona” to cover up an
undesirable inner reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mixing of antithetical positions within the same mind causes the
cognition to cover both fields, “to hunt with the hounds as well as run with
the hares.” At one time the assertions, compulsions, hatred, etc. can assert
itself. At another time one is kind and fair. Duplicity is when the kind and
fair side refuses to really recognize its shadowy counterpart. Or perhaps its
the stable side of the personality with its seemingly confident sense of
identity that distorts or denies a weak and insecure part of the personality.
Duplicity can manifest itself in various ways. What is central to this
tendency is that it is an attempt at keeping two antithetical forces from
clashing with each other. At the same time this tendency is a block to
integration and wholeness that is possible at the Anahata Vortex.
Duplicity manifests as hypocrisy when the more intelligent part of the
being recognizes its inferior parts but attempts to compensate for them by
setting up higher standards that cannot possibly be met by a dual and
divided mind. For example, such a person may express may express crude
and lewd behavior in the company of his friends, but denounce that same
behavior while at work or church in order to uphold a persona of social
respectability.
Duplicity is all too easily found in religious groups where insecure people
have the need for others to guide or influence them spiritually. Without
even mentioning sexual deviance, there is still a mountain of dangerous
examples of duplicity in religion. Duplicity allows hidden tendencies to
burrow deep into these minds while the “demons” of spiritual vanity and
the desire to manipulate and control others become the primary objective.
Once good intentionality has degenerated, what virtue is left to protect one
from the darkest parts of the shadow? Its the same situation whether they
wear white collars or orange robes or rattle off scriptural sayings in Latin or
Sanskrit: people that deceive and harm others spiritually through their
hypocrisy have very hard falls into perversion. What was repressed and
hidden becomes so painfully evident after a fall. Spiritually-minded people
with discernment, or viveka, cannot tolerate these activities and belong to
any groups that lie and cover up these truths. A spiritually conscious person
either has to get out of the web of lies or become an agitator or
revolutionary, a “heretic.” Insight must extend beyond the names and
forms of religion. “It is alright to be born into a sect, but not to die in one”,
said Vivekananda.
It is natural to have duality in human existence. Sometimes we are
strong and other times we are weak and cannot resist negative tendencies.
There is so much uncertainty in deeper existential matters and values.
Duplicity, however, is when the mind censors and covers up the
inconvenient truths by fractioning off and compartmentalizing the
personality into a false image. This image is untrue in that it is an
argumentation against another, undesirable part of one’s being. One
declares war upon oneself. Natural duality and indecision take on a
distorted belief system about oneself where only one side of the dual
equation is true. The more one represses and distorts the shadow, the more
of a “true believer” one becomes. Fanaticism and a lot of argumentation is
needed to quell the shadow. It takes a lot of internal psychological work
and/or spiritual practice to integrate the disparate parts of the personality
and become whole. And this is only possible with a very positive view of
existence that permits the shadow to dissolve in this light little by little.
Instead of becoming whole and congruent, duplicity loves to project its
inner, repressed tensions of conscience onto some “other”. Instead of
seeing what is vile and low inside oneself it is much easier to find a scape-
goat outside of oneself. Be careful entering into the shadow area of another,
whether it is an individual or a collective society. Projections of the shadow
are the perfect medium to transfer one’s own dark side onto another. The
“other”, the “enemy” may turn out to be the revealer of truth, however. It
may be your best friend in that one can really begin to understand this
unconscious game of shadow projection that has the whole world going
insane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most subtle expression of duplicity is the recognition of the fact that
there is only one, integral consciousness in the universe but I still can’t let
go of my ego with its projections of name and form onto the supreme
unspeakable reality. Following a particular religion or path is an ephemeral
reality of ego that deep inside I know is quite relative and very limited but
always seems to stick to me and convince me of its reality. There is also the
fear that Jesus, Baba, or whomever is one’s guru will punish one for letting
go of the name and form and approaching the nameless godhead. The
formless god says “no more of this” and unifies you with the Om that is
beyond but vibrates every particle of this universe! Om will always drown
out your little words for god. Only a direct, unmediated understanding of
Oneself destroys all religious belief and dogma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complete purification of this vrtti of duplicity purifies the right, solar
side of the Anahata Vortex and allows one to contemplate the pure “I” at its
seat in the human spiritual heart. Without this vortex of duplicity vibrating
and bifurcating the right side of the anahata, the vedantic sages
contemplated the pure Self in the right side of the chest where it radiates
outward in innocence and purity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After duplicity there are two more vrttis in the anahata, argumentation and
repentance. One can keep up the act, the duplicitous war of soul attrition, a
little longer with the ammo of argumentation or put an end to it with a deep
feeling of regret or repentance and change course toward what is
eventually complete surrender of the ego.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-dynamics-of-ta-and-tha-in-argumentation-and-repentance&quot;&gt;The Dynamics of “Ta” and “Tha” in Argumentation and Repentance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Anahata is the moral battleground in the war of dharma. Dharma
means the true essence of something independent of our varied
interpretations of it, the thing-in-itself. In this case dharma refers to human
nature. We can see in the Anahata that there are innate and humane
tendencies that seek to direct the mind toward subtlety and universal
humanism (hope, expansion, conscience), but at the same time there
evolve these abstract, egocentric protection mechanisms that keep the
person bound into limited thought and feeling (worry, vanity, egoism,
duplicity). If the Anahata is aligned more with a true sense of self rather
than a vain sense of egoism, then the Anahata expands and the person
becomes more spiritually oriented. However, this effort to expand towards
spirit is something new for the materialistic mind. The good conscience of
human beings is all too easily corrupted by bad ideology and social
conventions. Instead of being fostered and enforced by our social
institutions it is often suppressed or distorted. For example, so many
Americans feel pain and sympathy when they see images of dead Iraquis or
Afghanis, but their conditioned national sentiments never let them truly go
against the grain and transcend these superficial, imposed ideas. Most
people find ways to justify even these actions in order to hold on to some
sense of pride in their collective identity. Argumentation is a form of
cognitive dissonance in which the intellect identifies with the false form of
conscience and argues against their true moral conscience. In this
example, the conscience takes the side of “God Bless America” instead of
the more intuitive conscience that says “this is all a lie.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ta” is the sound vortex behind the propensity of argumentation.
Because it is a movement against true conscience, it is always doomed to
fail. Pure justice or dharma doesn’t require the arguments of the ego and is
a higher tendency in the Vishuddha. This noble concern for universal
welfare is backed by dharma, which is the balance of consciousness and
action, of Shiva and Shakti. However, argumentation in the Anahata always
has a shadow, and therefore a weakness. “Tha” is the sound of the return
of the weakened force of argumentation that wants to come back to center,
in alignment with true conscience and dharma. One desires to be whole
again after having become fragmented by so many argumentations and
false stories of self. “Tha” manifests the propensity of repentance. One
truly has suffered and perhaps made others suffer. The only way out of this
suffering is to become more aware, take responsibility and make some
major decisions. Only in this manner will the separate, willful, and
egocentric mind ever abandon its arguments and justifications for its baser
tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argumentation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next to last vrtti of the Anahata Vortex is argumentation. In general,
argumentation is a way for the ego to defend itself against uncertainty by
summoning up reasons and arguments to convince others or oneself of
being right. We convince others through verbal argument, we convince
ourselves through mental argument, through our inner thought conflicts. So
often, when one argues with another in an effort to convince, one is really
only unconsciously trying to preserve the projections of the mind from
falling into doubt and uncertainty. The separate ego always needs to think
that its position as center of its universe is secure.
It is all too easy for the argumentative mind to fall into lower
propensities like hatred, ambition, fear, shame, lack of confidence and so
on. An offended ego can even come to blows with another.
Since argumentation is a reaction to our own inferior, unaccepted and
rejected parts of ourselves like shame and guilt, human beings want to
project this discomfort onto somebody or something else as a psychic
purge. The people who are really like us in our most hidden ways are the
people who are most threatening and should be judged accordingly. When
we make judgments against others we not only condemn them but our own
shadowy parts as well. And so with this form of argumentation and
judgment we create a rift and boundary between self and others and also
between self and other parts of self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a spiritual perspective one sees argumentation as an attempt to
defends one’s projections of how the ego fits into its personal, social, and
spiritual realities. Normally, a person is not very secure within. Our beliefs
are adopted from others or we anxiously or unconsciously cling to some
“ideology” to secure our footing in reality. It is this very weakness in lack of
true awareness that creates the need for argumentation. Behind most
ideologies is fear and insecurity and the ideology attempts to assuage this
tension. We often believe in something or someone out of ignorance,
desperation, laziness, or superficial conformity. It is important to realize
these parts of our personal “ideology” so we don’t fall into complacency and
one-sidedness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the deeper sense argumentation is indecision. “Is this morally
correct?, am I really living to my full capacity?, am I in harmony with my
universe?” It is quite natural and even useful in the expansion of the mind if
indecision is not carried to far. All realizations are a result of clash and
cohesion. When argumentation internalizes it begins to touch a truer
reason, balanced with intuition and compassion in the spiritual heart. Here
the mind is safe and secure and can finally begin to use the discerning
intellect to ask the right questions. The mind begins to ask, “Who, which
part of me, is thinking this and with what motive and intention?” Through
this discernment and self-knowledge we eventually learn to simply let the
Witness into the thoughts and feelings, to let it purify them. This
spontaneously and unintentionally changes the mind by internalizing the
thoughts. If a photon is changed by our expected perception of it being a
particle or a wave, then just imagine how would our thoughts and feelings
and even our entire mind is changed by simply being witnessed by the
Supreme Consciousness within. To surrender the mind into the sublime
silence of the Witness creates a reverberation of grace as an echo from this
silence. All mental distortions and problems, no matter how great, may be
straitened out by making the mind parallel with the Witness, by becoming
one with my source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can one be centered in the Witness when the mind is so confused,
split, and unconscious of itself? Unifying the mind with the essence of
awareness makes the mind full of this awareness and purifies all the little
dark, hidden caves for psorax. By relating with the most subtle entity the
mind begins to mimic that entity, instead of the shadow. Mind always wants
to merge into Shiva, into Consciousness. This is its fundamental attraction.
Only by going seeing beyond the mind can we truly see the mind. Mind is
not the fundamental being; it is not the Witness, but is being witnessed.
One can see one’s whole life, past present, and future merging into an
Eternal Now from this perspective. Rilke asked, “Who really lives this life
anyhow, is it you God?” The mind is known to the Witness as its own little
self, a little wave on its own ocean, a self-becoming progeny being
constantly and eternally born out of its Infinite being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repentance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends once asked me why I didn’t get angry with a mechanic who
once took my engine out, apparently reinstalled it by putting everything in
its place but only tightened the nuts and bolts with his fingers. I say that
somebody like that is already self-condemned. The best thing I could do for
him was to rebuke him so as to try to induce a little repentance so that his
attitudes no longer serve to degenerate him to even deeper levels of
deceit. We condemn ourselves through our selfish and ignorant actions and
may continue to suffer the reactions for a very long time.
I am capable of feeling empathy for another and try to understand his
point of view no matter how distorted it may be, and my only desire in
wanting to reprimand him be that he reform himself so as not to continue to
be just another burden on human society. If I am capable of this state of
mind, then the Macrocosmic mind must be capable of so much more. What
we call god is not an avenger or punisher, but only a savior. While it is true
that the laws of karma are inviolable even for god, there are subtle
mechanisms that the Macrocosmic mind has evolved through the
microcosm to bring erring minds back into harmony with existence.
Repentance is not shame or the desire to induce shame or any other
negative tendency into another. Repentance is a very deep and self-
reflective pattern of very rational thoughts and emotions that save one
from the self condemnations of shame. Everything that this little mind of
ours does is interacting with a great universe, a conscious and intelligent
system that pre-exists us and is a lot more aware than one could ever
imagine. The blind and selfish mind only becomes aware of this after much
suffering. Having burned oneself with the fire of suffering and alienation
over and over, one finally begins to awaken and see the law of cause and
effect at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To an awakening mind there will always be an opportunity for the
intelligent moral order of the universe to create conditions of grace so as to
call and welcome all microcosms back into unity with the Macrocosmic
Consciousness. The signs are all around but due to selfishness and
separation we cant allow ourselves to really understand them. Grace is for
all but is only understood through a mature mind. This soul naturally
desires a subtler form of existence and once shown the way it is only quite
natural that there is a bit of compunction and repentance for having existed
away from union in suffering and delusion. Repentance can only exist
where there is truly a notion of discernment or viveka (the 6th propensity)
to contrast and reflect the errors of the separate ego. When one truly knows
that the inability to understand ones fears, attachments, resentments and
ambitions have locked one into an absurd existence with no real purpose,
the idea of continuing or falling back into the vain traps of the ego becomes
unbearable. One never wants to return to such a state because it is based
in suffering and delusion. Repentance serves as a microcosmic expression
of the laws of action and reaction and how they are embedded in our
mental structures and is a check and balance system for maintaining
harmonious conduct with the universe. To have experienced the great
wonder of existence, to have encountered a little bit of the infinite presence
in a few clear moments of grace, and to sustain them through meditation
and devotion will always keep ones direction onward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I speak of repentance as the last mental vortex of the spiritual
heart, it can just as well be considered the first if we count from below
upward. Its controlling sound “tha”, is the densest vibration of the Anahata
Vortex. It couples “ta”, a sound dominated by staticity and inertia with “ha”,
the sound of centripetal movement. Repentance, or “tha,” therefore serves
as a propensity that leads all of the dross and density of the human heart
back into the purity of pure spirit. When there are no vrttis to create pride
or repentance that perturb the essence of the spiritual heart, one becomes
empty of form and intention but full of Infinite Consciousness. One’s self is
sacrificed to the heart of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is true that all actions of the microcosm are compensated with
reactions, there are some profound patterns in the mind that truly lead the
microcosm into union. These actions don’t rebound with reactions but
rather dissolve themselves into the Macrocosm. “Be altogether lost in
Shiva, like an arrow in its target.” Because the devoted mind really does
begin to flow and find grace it is received and absorbed into the life of the
universe, reactions of pain and sorrow begin cease because the ego puts up
fewer and fewer projections of separation and makes fewer errors based on
them. The influence of the Vishuddha Vortex enters here. Spiritual practice,
no matter what name or form, must be a practical vehicle to re-align the
microcosmic mental flow with that of the Macrocosmic thought projection
which is this universe. To bring the mind with all of its desires, feelings and
ideas into the light of the I-Witness transforms and expands the limits of the
microcosm. Contemplating the ever-present Atman within one’s very own I-
feeling, the microcosm undergoes spiritual, mental, and biological
evolution; the structures of the mind change and vibrates on higher
frequencies, and the body that it incarnates undergoes subtle
metamorphoses in the nervous and endocrine systems to accompany and
parallel the mental changes. Participating in evolution as a responsible
individual is the greatest duty that a human being has toward the collective
evolution of humanity to something truly dignified and deserving of the
divine potential within.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-free-self&quot;&gt;The Free Self&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the vrttis of the spiritual heart are understood and liberated, their
energy retires inward into pure idea. One feels that from the center of the
chest extends an element of a subtle, invisible air that is not bound by any
form of gravity in this universe. From this realm of light and vibrant pulsing
ideas manifest the entire physical universe. This universe is dominated by
the play of the centripetal and centrifugal forces in a constant combat that
can only be regulated by the Macrocosmic Mind that has spawned them. In
this Aerial Factor we find the nexus between the abstract and material
worlds. Although the aerial factor is a form of energy bound by the
Macrocosmic process of creative involution, the consciousness that
penetrates there isn’t split into particularities of time, space, or person. The
I-feeling is still pure and undivided. Idea is more real than matter. To move
up from here is complete dissolution of the phenomenal self into Spirit, to
move down from here is the materialization of this self into the physical
universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A yogi may delight in this ecstasy: to let oneself flow outward only from
the spiritual heart and aerial factor so that your being may touch every
particle of the universe. Everything becomes familiar and pure, even what
is impure wants to change and transform. But even this cannot be
sustained by us forever, it is the drama of the Macrocosm that will go on
forever and ever. There is a part of you that gazes down upon this as well.
To just go inward from here is to deliver to Shiva so many quantum, so
many packets of energy, that have been trapped by Shakti’s great gravity
into material form. All the star-stuff that we have taken in through
digestion, through perception, through ideas and interaction are finally
brought into the Intuitive Mind and liberated from all form through your
recognition that only Shiva exists both within and without. We transmute
creation into godhead each time we truly remember home. Mind is but the
entity that regulates the within and the without, the centripetal and
centrifugal. Macrocosmic mind, or Shiva, sustains and projects the whim
of the entire cosmological order. Microcosmic mind is what contains and
projects this whimsical bundle of ideas and impressions in time and space
with a notion of your person.&lt;/p&gt;

The previous chapters have been the result of years of study.  I wrote these chapters around 2005 and am now editing them.  In the explaination of the classifications and function microvita I have tried to be as rational and objective as possible with these very subjective experiences.  I tried to keep these ideas based on my own experience as much as possible without extrapolating ideas.  This is a fundamental duty for the spiritual investigator of tantric and microvita science.  One should try to be as objective as possible while removing personal prejudices or ideological biases that skew interpretations of these subtle perceptions.  Aurobindu saw yoga as “mystical empiricism.”  I like the spirit empirical science, of having cross-references and peer review and think that yogis who try to teach metaphysics to others should be as scientfically minded as possible, scrutinize their own experiences, and review them with other investigators.  It is a rigorous, self-critical position that I have tried to maintain throughout the work.  Now for the fun improvisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following stories are collections of personal experiences or experiences of people close to me.  There are no literary exaggerations.  Only a few small details have been changed in a few stories regarding the people involved.  I did not want to reveal the deep experiences of others in my book.  Instead, I attributed just a few of these real experiences of people very close to me to myself, the narrator in these stories.  Now it is time to apply theory.  I hope you can discern between some various classes of positive mentities like the Siddhas, Vidyadharas, Yaksas, etc., as well as understand the influence of some negative mentities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-few-stories-of-quetzal-manik-pluma-blanca&quot;&gt;A Few Stories of Quetzal Manik (Pluma Blanca)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pluma Blanca always had a very elevated vibration. When people came near him they would begin to sway in a counter-clockwise direction. Sometimes their heads would begin to tilt and subtly twirl in an almost imperceptible circular motion. He explained that whether you are speaking of the Cosmic Nucleus of Hunab Ku or the Conscious Nucleus of the Atman radiating behind our minds, the movement around either a physical or spiritual nucleus is always a play of the centripetal and centrifugal forces. They have the same dynamics on all planes of being. There are physical vortexes of motion in the physical world where there is the weight and gravity of matter and also vortexes of subtle, mental energy that act and interact with thoughts, feelings, and perceptions. To harmonize the macrocosm with the microcosm, the universe with the individual, one must find this secret flow of Tao both within the mind and in one’s world, planet, and its plants and animals.
On the outside Pluma Blanca’s ancestors studied the movement of the planets and the natural cycles. This practice was never disconnected to the internal practice of meditation. Meditation is the science of seeing behind all of the vortexes and movements of the human mind. A mind that is pure sees into and understands the movements around Hunab Ku, the Cosmic Nucleus that is within us all. Every human being that has truly searched has seen into this great treasure deep within a balanced human existence. We understand that there is always something pure, eternally renewed when we live in harmony with creation. This inspiration has never abandoned us, only we have forgotten It.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Not So Fleeting Romance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pluma Blanca (White Feather), or Quetzal Manik (in maya), came by the clinic for a surprise visit a few years ago. It was my first time to see him. He seemed to know all about me but didn’t say very much. He hardly even spoke Spanish. He liked to talk to me about Tantra and share ideas of the Tantra of the Mayas, the lineage of meditation and healing that he learned from his fore-fathers. Although a healer of all types of diseases, he was fundamentally a mystic who loved to meditate in the forest. He was my wife’s teacher, an indigenous Maya from Campeche. When my wife was attending a European patient he went to the clinic and entered the treatment room directly. He grabbed a pencil and a piece of paper and then wrote down a list of names on the paper. The names were the first and last names of the lovers the young woman had in the last year. The list was a little too long.
He would speak in Maya but nobody understood him. He then began to write to her in Spanish while somebody else translated to her in English. He explained that when humans have sexual intercourse their minds remain energetically connected for 7 years. There is a subtle transmission and continued connection of mental energy shared between the 2 entities. This may be something very pure and harmonious or it may be painful or even degrading, depending on the nature of the relationship. Even though they may never see, nor even think of each-other again, there remain subtle mental impressions that “reside” within each-other.
Another complicating factor is the mental confusion that one carries if one changes or has frequent partners. The imbalanced, frustrated, and distorted energies of others sympathetically vibrate with the minds of an individual person, and vice-versa. It sounded as if he was speaking of the transmission of a mental virus in much the same way as a physical virus, but with the mind and its clusters of memories and emotions as the vehicle of transmission directly into another mind. Instead of being infected physically, one remains “infected” by another’s mind for 7 years. A part of that person’s soul, or subtle mind is carried inside and continues to live inside of another, for better or for worse. The soul becomes an over-crowded house instead of a silent temple.
He explained quite compassionately that her emotional instability was only worsened by her romantic adventures and were gradually making her physically ill. She was an attractive young woman with very liberal values who simply didn’t understand these ideas before he explained it to her. She didn’t feel threatened nor judged, and seriously pondered his diagnosis. I believe that her conscience understood what Pluma Blanca was communicating. She knew she was suffering and wasn’t happy and somebody had just probed into her private life to offer her some clues as to how to understand her confusions. Before the treatment she was terrorizing all of the young spiritually-disciplined boys around here with her tiny, mini skirts. After that treatment she put on a more modest skirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Om in C &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Pluma Blanca was born 114 years on this planet earlier than when I met him, he was a perfect child who always liked to share his toys with me. This little Indian always radiates joy, at least when he isn’t scolding people. On one of our first meetings he just looks at me and mentally says, “first go into silence, hear Om in breathlessness and then take note of its tone.” I could hear the Om sound vibrating within and it seemed to correspond something close to the tone of C. I got my flute out and played a C and it sounded like I was playing at the same tone as the sacred Om sound that was resounding around my pineal gland. Later he said, “Now hear it in C-sharp.” My head went back and I started to lose contact with the outside world and be absorbed into a great white silence that the Om at C-sharp was taking me into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I came back down he said, “now what is in your mind?” I closed my eyes and saw so many images and histories and stories flash before my mind. He continued: “You will verify all of this in the next few years. It will all come to pass.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These events indeed are coming to pass, like entries in an apocalyptic diary. It was the saddest story ever conceived, although the story should soon change for the better. My friend could see the future and help his friends to do the same. Spiritual experiences like this don’t happen so regularly as it is too powerful of an experience for most to digest. The present is challenging enough without knowing the future. Ignorance is sometimes a blessing, but Pluma Blanca knew that it was necessary to understand these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nahuatl &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pluma Blanca once told me that a Nahuatl is a healer that sees not just into the minds of animals but also into those of humans. Beyond even seeing into the souls of humans the true Nahuatl sees into the Oversoul, the conscious substatum that unites us all. He says that to enter a human mind is usually more difficult and dangerous than entering into a mind of an animal. Humans are less innocent and their mental contents may make such a rare and pure entity as a Nahuatl ill if he or she resonates too close with other human emotional turmoil. Animals see us as gods and naturally resonate with and reflect the mental states of their gods. The nahuatl prefers to see the mere reflection of a human’s problems by “hacking” the minds of the animals under their care. That way, the contact with the other human mind is not too direct and doesn’t affect the seer and also the minds of those seen into. Also,people often feel strangely transparent and often uncomfortable when they feel that another can see through them. Animals, like innocent children, may give very truthful and unbiased information and just tell it like it is. Although a dog can’t speak, they reflect most of this human resonance unconsciously and what lives and vibrates in the mind of the master is also there in the mind of the canine disciple. A nahuatl may learn many things about you through your dog, horse, or even donkey!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been said that very developed tantric yogis have the power of mind over matter in that whatever they put their focused, disciplined minds on will certainly materialize. Though quite rare, there have been numerous examples of yogis with these bizarre qualities through the ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day Pluma Blanca (White Feather) came to visit bon Nadie at Rancho el Misterio. He spoke much of this phenomenon with practical examples. He said that developed shaman really can even have some degree of control over the weather. This amazed bon Nadie the most as Pluma Blanca was so calm and unsensational while speaking about these abilities. Rather, he took these truths very seriously. He always warned about these abilities, however. “What if you lose control of an emotion and end up manifesting your deepest shadow tendencies?,” he said. He was 110 years old and never spent much time in the cities but he really did understand modern people. The most amazing and diffult thing to believe is when he told bon Nadie that Nahuatls (those who enter the minds of animals) are real and that they can look into the Oversoul of humanity and into the Divine Eye that sees past, present, and future. They can see all minds, not just those of animals.  He said that it is nice to see a human mind from time to time, but he mostly just sees animal minds in human form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back south, bon Nadie took him to a store to buy some food for the trip. It was an elite part of town. Most people had skin the same color of bon Nadie’s. However, instead of the usual ignorance or normal sociability toward his person, he noticed that some people gave him nasty, scornful looks. They looked even worse at Pluma Blanca. Bon Nadie remained still, just looking back at them. He was in a light, dreamy trance  and saw so much bad history, impunity, suffering and hateful prejudice behind these people’s expressions. He was angry at their ideas and where they come from but still couldn’t judge these superficial people, except to say that they are superficial people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One woman was particularly rude and pushed him to the edge of his patience. She thought that bon Nadie was one of her kind based on appearances. When he didn’t respond to her flirtations, she became downright spiteful and said under hear breath, “maldito indio” or “damned indian.” He wanted to respond and say:  “because my heart is the same as my friends, then I too am a damned indian.” However, Pluma Blanca came over laughing and pulled him out of the store. “Let your wife pay, we will wait out here,” he said. I knew that he knew I was a little annoyed. He sait quietly for several minutes and then responded: “They will get their lessons very soon.” Now Pluma Blanca was known as an oracle and I wasn’t sure if he was speaking about the future of the world and all of the racists and imperialists or if he was talking about this one woman in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that moment the racist woman came out of the store and Pluma Blanca began to giggle like a small child. It was as if he had done something naughty and was trying to hide it. A stray dog approached the woman, raised his leg, and soaked her stockings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;non-dualism-cures-all-disease&quot;&gt;Non-Dualism Cures All Disease&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a friend, a recluse yogi, who has the ability to heal any disease. He is still alive, but considering the state of collective insanity on the planet, that could very well change. These big brothers have too much burden to carry right now. So that a little dharmic, moral order can begin to influence human society again, there must first be some major cleansing. He says that people trapped in the human, materialistic urban matrices are becoming physically and mentally ill due to the inability to harmonize their physical, mental, and spiritual strata of existence with society, nature, the planet and the universe. This recluse friend doubts if modern humans really are fit to continue evolving on this planet. His opinion matters because to me because I have seen him heal many incurable diseases simply by looking at somebody. These people healed aren’t patients because he isn’t a healer, at least he doesn’t consider himself one. They are just people who happen to cross his path at the opportune time. I dare not give away his identity or his whereabouts because the people would devour him with their troubles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sees all illness as a projection of mental conflicts or imbalances. By intuitively seeing the illness as distorted thoughts or repressed emotions such as fear, anger, or insecurity, he sees how this flow of mental energy interacts with the organs and glands of the body. Maybe this person can’t tell you so much scientifically about the immune system, T4 cells, etc., but he has been known to heal cancer. Maybe one can’t empirically verify how he does it but it is easy to verify that the cancer disappeared. As a close friend, I ask him how he does it. He doesn’t give away many secrets if one isn’t first capable of understanding them, but one thing I have gathered is that he has some way of taking these illnesses into his own being, like the classic “sin eaters.” Perhaps the cancer of one person gives him diarrhea for a few days, or AIDS makes him physically weak for a few weeks. His advanced meditation and yoga practice constantly heal him of these illnesses. If he stops meditating or spends too much time in the city with the mundane, then he gets ill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What he shared with me is that all illnesses are clusters of unprocessed, unconscious thoughts and emotions that attack the physical body by first creating imbalances in the glandular system. For him not to have the same illness, he must process the thoughts and emotions of the other as if they were his own. If he doesn’t understand these mental patterns behind the illness, then his physical body suffers the same symptoms as the afflicted. I can’t get him to tell me how he does it exactly. He is smug in his non-dualist philosophy and simply says that there is only one being in the universe and this being is only understood by the unprejudiced, tranquil and insightful minds. By understanding this fundamental truth, the mind becomes free of all complexes and relieves the body of having to bear the cross of all of the ego’s ignorance and unconsciousness that create illness and disharmony. He really can explain a little more, but prefers to let people figure it out for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;form-and-formless&quot;&gt;Form And Formless&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Brahma alone is the guru.” This saying from the Upanishad represents a very universal conception of the deity. Brahma literally means that which is great and makes others great. In other words, Brahma is the Consciousness of the Macrocosm, of the entire universe. The guru is none other than the Supreme Consciousness and cannot be tainted by partiality nor prejudices nor any relative projection of a messiah or human guru. What is, simply is. If the Supreme Consciousness can create this entire universe, then surely there is an unmediated, direct way to communicate with me, a little microcosm in this Macrocosm. “Am I a secluded figure, in the vast, a little ameagre? No no no no I am not alone, the great is with me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one could imagine that such a Macrocosmic deity is not a petty god of a certain country or class or society of exclusive human beings that deserve his mercy. The tiny little human microcosmic mind with its prejudices and attachments finally understands that “god” is not to be found through any finite form, material nor mental. The sacred books and messiahs and Buddhas were just approximations of a an inner, mystical truth. Only those who dare question the root of their being free of these appendages could possibly find the root of their being free of all relative conditioning. Non-dualism, or Advaita, is the idea that ultimately the consciousness of the individual microcosm and the Macrocosm are fundamentally the same. This is not to say that my consciousness has become the consciousness of the universe, that the ego becomes god. Rather, my consciousness has been taken into, accepted, transformed, digested, and finally assimilated into the living, working consciousness of the Macrocosm or Brahma. The microcosm is no longer a separate entity creating negative reactions and contaminating the world while fleeing from one empty dream to the next. The illumined microcosm is a mental cell unified with other mental cells that form a Macrocosm, a collective body of minds. Here, one can’t bring attachments, prejudices, nor any other petty ego control issue. The moment they arise, the Macrocosm knocks you off of your feet. It takes much time and evolution and trial and error to find a flow of unity into the Macrocosm. One must unlearn the socially-conditioned and indoctrinated ego along with all of its hereditary mental and biological instincts in order to learn the ways of Brahma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only those born with developed intuitive faculties can understand these truths without following teachers or paths. Life just somehow teaches these inner lessons. I suspect that these minds are “primed” with this knowledge from birth and that it was probably learned earlier. Plato saw all knowledge as something that has already been learned. What we experience here in the finite world are recollections of truths already known. Genius, according to this view, is nothing more than having at one’s disposal what has already been learned. Spiritual orientation is innately developed in some just as art or music or mathematics is innately developed in others.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p lang=&quot;es-ES&quot;&amp;gt;The idea of a human guru or a spiritual teacher is to help one understand these fundamental cardinal truths of non-dualism. A guru is one who has walked that path and is capable of showing it to others. However, most of the time, a concept of guru is but an opiate for a desperate personality separated from the life of the universe due to its ignorance and egoism. Belief is mostly desperate compulsion and the idea of a guru is often a 2-edged sword. Normally, when people speak to you about gurus they want to sell you on some idea. They often want others to bandy together with them under some omnipotent messiah, guru, and their religion or institution. They don’t really want to have their own experiences but prefer just to adopt the ideas and traditions of others to find security and refuge. The more absolute the idea, the more effective is the opiate and the more placated is the compulsion of the fearful and separate little ego to grasp on to some form of meaning&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one works through these limited ideas of a guru, then perhaps one can really understand something of another human being that is wise and compassionate and only has your well-being in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came to believe that Anandamurti was a true guru. I never met him in physical form. I was convinced of his special character because of his disciples. These exceptional human beings considered Anandamurti as their guru and that naturally gives one a certain reverence toward their teacher. There was once a Sufi teacher who knew of Anandamurti and respected him greatly. He sent one of his disciples to see him. The disciple went to see him but only saw an absurd show of dogmatic followers running about in an absurd guru-devotee show. The master rebuked him and told him he was only judging external appearances. What he should have seen is that the master (Anandamurti) was so great that he accepted all people, even clowns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I made it past the show of spiritual salesmen and was able to meet some of the more mature disciples of Anandamurti, both monastic and lay. In general, the community of Ananda Marga was very respectable. There were people from all strata of society working and moving together under the inspiration of Anandamurti. The problems mostly resided with the monastic institution after the death of Anandamurti. The more mature meditators didn’t have any doubts about the divinity of their teacher but were never dogmatic about it nor tried to impose it on others. They put their meaning in doing practical work and sincere spiritual practice. Near these mature disciples one could feel a certain lightness and expansion of mind that helps one to realize that the guru is deep within, inside of one’s deepest sense of peace. This influence made meditation much clearer and peaceful. It seemed impossible to cling to any form of teacher when one feels at one with the living Macrocosm of Brahma. I began to see an inner light that radiated into every form that entered my mind. I saw the same spirit both within and without. I became certain that I was not my body nor my mind and so how was it possible to cling to some human guru form? However, none of these elder teachers ever tried to impose this form upon me and the stories that I well tell of them will hopefully help other people appreciate the philosophy and spiritual practices of Anandamurti.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p lang=&quot;es-ES&quot;&amp;gt;When I first arrived at Ananda Nagar I met a yogi who told me some very useful secrets. He immediately took me into his confidence. He looked at me intensely and I felt like I was being scanned. The first thing he told me was a tip of how to transmute sexual energies. I had never heard a monk talk about things so openly, yet with such intelligence and purity. Far from being perverse or hypocritical fantasies of a celibate monk, it was the most practical insight into desire that I had heard of in my life. As a young single man I greatly appreciated his insights. The second important thing he told me is that some day Ananda Marga will probably end up killing their own saints. He laughed heartily but he was serious. It was inconceivable to me at the time. Furthermore, it seemed like heresy because everybody else was only talking how great Ananda Marga was and how Anandmurti left all of his power and grace in this organization! Now, 20 years later, I see what he meant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, on another visit, he told me how yogis can leave their bodies and travel through the inner dimensions of time and space. He said it was another reality in which there exist not these relative factors of time and space. It was a Dreamland that was even more real than physical reality, a kind of astral repository of all human experience and memory-past, present and future. He said that you could know whatever you needed to know and meet whoever you needed to meet on this plane of reality. I was eager to visit this Hall of the Immortals. He told me how to leave my body and at what time of night I could do it. I left the conversation with a desire to see if I could somehow know something of the teacher of these great men that I was meeting and was inspired by. Later that night I followed the prescribed technique. Nothing happened at that moment. Later I slept and then it started to work. I awoke completely with a holy jolt of spiritual lightning in my spine. I could feel the kundalini rising. I could feel it swishing through the cerebral spinal fluid that was concentrating inside the brain. When it entered inside the head there was only light and sound, every color was within white and every sound within Om. All through the night there was a whirling vortex of energy moving around the crown of my head. It had no form, just sound and color. I was entirely awake but the more the kundalini rose the more I entered into a very conscious state of trance. It was more real than anything I had ever experienced. Rather than a world with forms and mass, all was very fine and soothing vibration. I understood how the crown chakra and the pineal gland were the microcosmic receptor and channel to enter into the formless, infinite Macrocosm. Everything made sense as pure idea. There was no fear or uncertainty of this unknown reality. All was bliss and I felt quite free and pure. I realized that my body was lying on my bed in a trance but that my consciousness was very clearly in the Present without names and forms. Every once in a while I would see the form of Anandamurti and the whole vibrational scene would turn into something more like a dream, only much more real and lucid. I thought “this is a dream”, but I knew it was a very special sort of dream. I still to this day recall it just as clear as a “waking” state of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this day I am still trying to realize the significance of these detailed conversations with the guru apparition. Perhaps it wasn’t absolutely necessary for him to appear as a human to another human in a state of lucid dream, but it was a very personal and affective touch from something or someone very sublime. As the years pass by these revelations become even clearer and life makes more sense. There was only so much I could understand as a little spiritual fledgling in my early twenties. They were experiences that by their very nature need a full life-time to be realized. Although I have never preached or tried to convince others about the divinity of Anandamurti, I have never ever doubted this influence in my life. For so many years I didn’t even speak of him. It was a subtle struggle of reconciling form with formlessness, and the idea that the guru archetype may actually appear with a human form. I always considered the latter as a relative possibility and never wanted my experiences to be some kind of “proof” for the ego to make fixed ideas about the infinite. This is a subtle error that causes great damage to an otherwise pure ideology, whether it is one’s personal set of ideas or the ideology of a spiritual society. If mystery, subtlety, and free speculationare substituted by concreteness and conformity, then only dogma will remain. Human beings armed with exclusive ideas always end up creating trouble for themselves and others. I always try to refer to Anandamurti’s philosophical ideas that the Supreme Consciousness is infinite and formless. With those who tried to impose the absolute form of the guru, I only saw religion in the making and soon learned that there was no sense arguing these matters. Over the years I have taught formless meditation with an entirely different system to others without referring to Anandamurti yet many of my students continue to have similar profound experiences and dreams of Anandamurti. It is something that only continues to grow silently inside of me and others. He himself only said that he was, is, and will remain a mystery. However, the philosophy he left is very clear, rational and lucid. I hope others find something special in his works that I am sharing. They were compiled as books, but all of them are based on talks that he gave over several decades to thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spiritual vision through the medium of mental forms is truly a form of divine grace. It is a certain illumination and showering of elevated thought and feeling that is designed by deep Intelligence to guide us onward and inward. Form helps us eventually understand the formless, the quiet I-Witness that is always now. Mystical vision is more than mere knowledge. Through it, knowledge is conveyed but in the most beautiful and meaningful manner. One could never throw such an experience away; each time it is recalled one gets the original message and merges into silent peace and joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Tarkovsky was the most mystical “image poet” of modern times in that he really could convey deep mystical ideas through cinematic form. When I see the last scenes of “Stalker” or “Solaris” I am deeply moved into an ecstatic reverie and marvel over the experience for hours, amazed that his genius could express something I always considered beyond expression. That is true poetry. However, even this beauty is really only an interpretation, and therefore limitation, of inner vision, which is always ineffable. Great mystic artists give just a little bit of what they inwardly see. Even Tarvovsky’s art pales in comparison to the truest, sincere vision of even the most humble mind. The kingdom of heaven is truly within and actively seeks prepared minds in its mysterious, inexhaustible variety of manifestations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I woke up just before dawn, I sat up in bed and even before I began to do a little meditation, I felt a strange vibration on the right side of my head. Inwardly, I looked at it and felt it and saw so very clearly in my mind’s eye a very gentle and friendly human form. I recognized him. I knew that this was all going on in the “Magic Theatre” within so I asked this apparition what he was doing here. No reply, just friendly, loving silence. I reflected and thought “Yes, I know why you are here. Your humanism moved me deeply and awakened something very profound but I have almost forgotten its origins and how it came to me in this life. Your Dr. Rieux in “The Plague” asked if it were possible to be a saint even if there were no god. He sacrificed everything for the well-being of others, yet he didn’t even believe in god. I always suspected this of you, that you could never put your compassion under a popular concept of what we call “god.” Those that didn’t grasp your depth called you an “Existentialist.” The actual human experience of compassion was something so much more than confusing, corrupt concepts. You initiated me into silent Buddha compassion before I even became familiar with Buddhist teachings. I suspect that many others were also helped by you, gentle angel who descended into the “absurd,” the 20th century. Is this where you are now, in this ethereal space, stimulating neurons of the incarnated so that we don’t forget love? Do you dwell within the universal spirit, are you just a memory within the collective mind of humanity still bound to this dusty earth, or just an apparition of my idiosyncrasies trying to make sense of themselves?” The apparition remains silent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The form disappears and I feel that same gentle pulsation that was in the left side of my head move into the right side of the chest, into the Spiritual Heart. Through the Spiritual Heart, mind rises high into a very fine light that surrounds the planet, a subtle, diaphanous spiritual atmosphere, I look down upon my valley from so high in this ethereal space. Unlike being in a plane or balloon and resisting gravity, everything is weightless and the forms are of pure light. The only movements are pulsations of thought and feeling. He came and showed me his perspective, how he sees things, how the “dead” gaze upon us, and then returned into the formless. The rocks of the mountains were just reflections of thought, all is sentient and made of light. Life is inherent in all things. I could vaguely see human faces taking form out of the mountain rocks. They are rough, turgid and unrefined like Neanderthals but an invisible force keeps loving them beyond time and form, purifying and refining them into something greater, beautiful and yet to be completed. An immense love looks down upon the planet and waits for all life forms to manifest and evolve spirit, slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So was Camus a symbol or a bodiless mind that came to me? It doesn’t matter. All phenomenal experiences of the mind, even the most spiritual visions, are at best maps and guides, friendly nudges from the universe to go here or there, or not to. The meaning of the vision is what is important. To feel at one with the earth, as I did in this experience, is something so profound that even though I write the vision of Camus off as an hallucination, the inner meaning of the experience is indelibly pressed upon my mind and I could never deny its beauty and sublimity. The vision inspires great feelings, perhaps something akin to what the bodhisattvas feel. Microvita are sentient intelligences that exist in the finer, mental planes of reality. They have many qualities and manifest through various forms of human nobility, valor, genius, and love. Did Camus express compassion or did Compassion express Camus? For the non-dualist there really is no difference. All souls are just sparks from the eternal fire of Brahma. These bodiless microvita guide the evolution of consciousness in all beings on the planet and even help shape our thoughts and feelings. This physical world really is a reflection of the inner workings of spirit. Imagination is the key to higher realities, and as Tagore noted, that with more imagination, the less imaginary something is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;neem-tree-and-flute-tantra&quot;&gt;Neem Tree and Flute Tantra&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;O yogi, sit in lotus under the sacred neem and together make impenetrable conscious force with nature. The death troopers will receive a great blessing from your practice. Infinite, white burning light penetrates and ignites their darkness. An immediate reaction shakes their world. Those who dealt so much terror may die in terror of Mother Kali, protector of the planet and of yogis. The next embryo they inhabit will finish its recapitulation with gills and fins. There they will “swim in idle waters and drink other fishes piss.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not many people understood the context of these phrases when I published them with this photo last year. It was a very dark time and I remembered a very dark punk rock song from my youth about reincarnation and how Oedipus complex-ridden perverts are reborn as fish. I never thought anything useful would come out of those memories but I realized that they were quite insightful! The narco death soldiers had just returned to the valley. They had come and gone several times in the last few years. Their soldiers get killed off regularly and there were always new ones ready to come and inhabit their nearby camp. There they keep hostages and then kill them and throw their bodies in the mountains.  I welcomed them back with a solo of Gluck’s “Dance of the Blessed Spirits” on my kena bamboo flute. I finished and they returned the message with gunfire. “Okay, now you all want some of my oboe too?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I truly felt protected and I didn’t worry. At first, I saw it as an ideational, meditative stance to create a protective field around our territory so as to keep their evil away. “As you think, so you become,” say the yogis. I won’t even consider it a possibility that they harm us, and so they won’t. However, as I continued to play and further pound them with Gluck and Bach, I realized that I was probably playing requiems for their upcoming departure from the planet. I thought of how those boys were probably forced into the paramilitary part of the cartel and they probably weren’t that different from the rest of the youth in the area. Human beings will do almost anything under forced coercion, at any time and any place. Soldiers hardly ever really know what they fight for. These boys are dying in a war insidiously designed to make Mexicans kill Mexicans while the gringos continue to rob their country blind. The plan is to let the locals do the raping and pillaging while the imperialists purposely take advantage of this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this realization, I played music for them not so much to scare them but to try to send these poor souls something beautiful. If they really are like the youth in this area, then they probably have suffered many deprivations and have never really felt much human warmth and compassion. There are very few nuclear families and almost all heads of the household are alcoholics. There are almost no opportunities for these outcasts. However, the system has designed a strategy to get rid of them and make money selling arms and drugs in the process.
They had already entered the ranch on a few occasions in the past. They are used to people being afraid of them. However, we decided to reprimand them. They were terrified. They said they heard voices in their heads and wanted to leave. They said they would give us their protection. “No thank you,” was the reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t recommend this technique unless one is very fearless and has a really strong mantra! When confronting evil forces that could easily destroy one’s physical being, one’s only protection is innocence and purity. There is fear because there are impurities. We don’t yet fully understand that we belong to immortality and so we attach our identity to some notion of worldly temporality. &lt;em&gt;Sadhana&lt;/em&gt; or meditation burns away the impurities and leads one to a natural state of innocence, at one with nature and spirit. “Who’s universe is this anyway, by what right do these narcos, their narco state and puppet governors have to wield this terror upon us?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Circumstances have given me proof time and again that the only true protection in this world is to be at one with dharma, the moral order of the universe. “Those who protect dharma are protected by dharma.” Dharma is not about beliefs or religion but rather getting to the essence of things by deep contemplation and then know how to react to the situation from this pinnacled, illuminated perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If for some reason I can’t concentrate in meditation, then a little spiritual music or kiirtan always helps. Instead of letting the mind be conditioned by terrible information coming from the world of men and their media, one surrenders to dharma, the silent and natural flow of events in the universe. One can truly feel the harmony of nature and spirit and that the force of &lt;em&gt;dharma&lt;/em&gt;, the conscious force of nature whose only purpose is to serve what is pure and innocent. The best meditation is that which is totally surrendered to Brahma; one desires nothing but simply enjoys being at one with Brahma, the supreme entity. Similarly, the best music is that which is played with spiritual devotion. While in meditation or playing music under the neems or the nearby ceiba tree one totally gets lost in spiritual ideation. With music and meditation along with the protection of the neems and ceiba, one can do the necessary work and create a spiritually-protected atmosphere. To always feel that the Supreme Entity is near and dear, is always loving and looking over, dissipates all fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-divine-mother&quot;&gt;The Divine Mother&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year before last was at the height of this so-called narco war in Northern Mexico. The narcos controlled the whole region and the local village. There was a command center 2 kilometers from our home where there were human skulls hung on the fence. Many of the local men were hired as lookout scouts to inform them if there was going to be an attack. The people in the village were very destitute and poor. Many families had inadequate food and clothing while the men spent their money on beer or crack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rancho Misterio began organizing some social service activities in the community. We even organized a mass with a very good Catholic Father in which the chanting of Baba Nam Kevalam was incorporated into a mass which the father gave. Giitanjali continued to take our crew to sing kiirtan twice a week with the community members. I usually stayed behind in the ranch with the heavy artillery in deep meditation and confident that nothing evil could befall my family. During that time the locals would pray to the Virigin of Guadalupe before and after singing kiirtan. During those times my meditation was so full of beautiful Christian ideas. I felt so closely the divine, motherly aspect of the divinity. She never appeared as a form, but rather the love that fills all space between all of the stars of the universe. At that time I realized the Virgin of Guadalupe has a shawl bedecked with stars and that the image is really a mix between an indigenous goddess and the Virgin Mary. I never really knew much of Catholicism personally but always knew many very good Catholic people. In my own way I had many internal apparitions and it was nice to feel like I understood the underlying meaning of the Divine Mother behind this image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that same time, there was an apparition of the Virgin of Guadalupe over the village. Everybody who wasn’t drunk saw it; that is, all of the women and maybe one or two of the men.
What I learned from this is that the divine cannot ultimately be trapped in any image but rather may use images to express deep truths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;possession&quot;&gt;Possession&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw the first images of carnage during the first Gulf War my last year in high school.  I was disgusted and ashamed. Although most of the teachers and leaders in society were supporting the government propaganda of a justified attack, there were also a few dissenters in the public school system who gave alternative views.  I had been influenced by one such teacher.  I really had no strong political views but I learned just enough of modern politics to entirely mistrust our government.  At the same time a giant boil appeared on my cheek.  It was enormous and swollen and very embarrassing.  As the fluid oozed out all I could think about were the images of the bodies of the hotel clerks in Bhagdad who were killed by misguided guided missiles.  I was ashamed to be an American.  No more John Wayne and heroic Green Berets saving the day; just filthy rotten imperialists and duped, flag-waving morons robbing and murdering weaker societies for their natural resources.  Well, for several years at least I vacillated between that extreme definition of my countrymen or the definition that they are also victims exploited by bad education and capitalist pseudo-culture. Either way, fascism always ends up taking hold of empires in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, for several years at least I vacillated between that extreme definition of my countrymen or the idea that they are also victims exploited by bad education and capitalist pseudo-culture.  Either way, fascism always ends up taking hold of empires just before their demise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the second invasion of Iraq in the spring of 2003 the boil returned in exactly the same place.  It was like a malevolent spirit that still haunted me.  I was no longer ashamed of being an American because I had become a universal citizen by then.  I really saw us as no more different than the German population around the time of Hitler.  However, I still had those same feelings of disgust with the mindless American populace that unwittingly goes along with the plans of the military industrial complex, bankers and politicians that make all of this profitable war business and propaganda possible.  More than just a rebellious attitude against authority, it was rather an attitude that these worms have no right to inflict this terror on any human being, especially when the justifications for aggression are based on crude lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had just moved to Mexico in 2003 and met a young couple who were very concerned about the war.  They were intelligent, educated, and had a very humanistic outlook.  They had a new-born baby at the time and were a very happy family. However, they were horrified at how the United States was so blatantly pulling off this scheme that any reasonable intelligent person unbiased by Fox or CBS could clearly see through.    The wife seemed to be deeply affected by the of war and was becoming even more so as time went on.  Although I don’t think they were actively protesting in the streets, I did hear of them attending some social and ceremonial gatherings of a pacific nature.  Slowly she began to become depressed and withdrawn.  Nobody heard from her anymore.  There was a Summer Solstice meditation event soon afterwards in which we heard from other friends that she had become very depressed, would not talk to anybody and was hardly even interested in caring for her baby.  Her husband was very worried and did not understand what was happening to her.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She arrived and gave a faint smile to everyone.  I hardly recognized her.  There seemed to be nobody at home.  My wife took her into a back room of the clinic away from all of the people participating in the festival in order to talk with her and give her some naturopathic treatments.  I could see her husband was very concerned and was having to give a lot of time helping to care for the baby.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About an hour later I was called back into the room.  My wife asked me to touch the crown of her head.  She asked me if I could feel something strange.  I did so and felt a terrible, evil presence.  It was similar to the feeling I had with my boil but much, much stronger.  I knew that this was an evil too powerful to be coming from her.  It was like a giant, super-personal plasma blob of evil that was in the room.  I felt sick and went into the next room to lie down.  Ten minutes later my wife came in and said her patient was feeling much better.  By that time I had already begun to decipher what was affecting her.  My wife saw that I was abnormal and asked me if I absorbed something.  I replied that I believe I had.  My heart was pounding as if I had run a marathon.  I could distinctly feel another presence inside of me.  I had never felt like there was some other being existing inside me before.  Yes, maybe I had had some strange experiences with deeper parts of my existence but it was always an experience with the various aspects of my own self.  My wife immediately lost her non-attachment as a healer and began to worry about me.  She wanted to take me to the hospital, which was quite ironic because she always “stole” patients from hospitals before the butchers took people’s organs out.  She was crying and begging me not to die.  I laughed and told her to shut up because I am fighting for my life with all of my force and the last thing I need is for my doctor to say I am going to die!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lied there all night listening to the suggestions of this dark entity.  I knew it was either it or I that would be alive in the morning.  Fortunately, my life was very full and vibrant and I didn’t accept any of the suggestions from this evil.  It was like a pattern that simply made everything negative and distorted-  pessimistic and destructive thoughts, hateful feelings, while at the same time it siphoned the life out of the body.  It was a contest to see which mental pattern would control this body, the evil plasma or my own conscience.  I could now understand very well what was affecting our friend and her family.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few hours I recovered a little.  The woman had fallen asleep and I went to speak with her husband.  I was exhausted but said that I believe everything will now be alright.  He seemed a little relieved.  I awoke with a terrible headache.  It stayed with me a week or so while this presence was being digested.  In the meantime the family learned meditation and we spent much time with the baby and all was alright.  It was the most terribly illuminating experience I had ever had up until that point in my life.  It was the beginning of a live microvita study that has only gotten wilder as the years pass on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-tree-tantra&quot;&gt;The Tree Tantra&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Tantra that I learned, Raja Di Raja Yoga, the techniques were very effective in awakening the kundalini. I began to enter the breathless state of samadhi very regularly when I was 23 years old. Although very intense, the practices gave the mind and body the maximum amount of transformation biologically, psychologically, and spiritually possible. However, nobody ever effectively taught me how to bring the kundalini back down. For years I was like a machine working at accelerated capacity. Sometimes I would go into trances while driving and my friend would have to grab the wheel. I would sometimes swoon and fall down while in a spiritual mood. My body once leaped 2 feet into the air when the kundalini awakened while I was sitting in the lotus posture. I cannot jump anywhere near that high in lotus if I try with my best effort and even when using my knees to bounce. This constant rising of the kundalini in me effected others as well, mostly for the good, but also negatively as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was immediately rejected from my yoga society after people knew I was having these experiences. I was told on several occasions by several monastics that I wanted those high samadhi states of realization, then I was in the wrong organization. At first I thought this was absurd. I had only done the practices that they had taught me. Samadhi, spiritual trance, is supposed to happen when the kundalini awakens after sincere practice. It would probably have been alright with them if they had these experiences. Many talked about my experiences much more than I ever did within their gossip circles. They finally admitted my experiences were real, but said that I would die before age 40 because of their intensity. Far from being a complement, they also wished more mundane misfortunes on me as well! I felt like I was the lowest creature on the planet for a little while. While receiving divine bliss on the inside, I received so much hatred from without. There was absolutely no possibility of developing an inflated ego out of these experiences because I was constantly negated by the slanderous talk about me. Later, I did realize that I was in the wrong society. I knew I wasn’t perfect but I wasn’t the narcissistic person that they made me out to be. “What Peter says about Paul says more about Peter than it does about Paul,” I realized. I left these practices entirely. The people who taught me them hated me with such intensity that I felt tremendous pain in my head each time I tried to meditate with their system. It was as if they had suspended my access to Spirit through their channels. Fine, that gave me an opportunity to find out what Tantra is really like, independent of dogmatic religious groups. However, I have always held great reverence to the  teachers that I met who really understood their own practices. If I would not have met these few exceptions, then I would consider my time with this society as a prison sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left the shelter of a spiritual society without knowing how to bring the kundalini back down, or at least to not be so intense and to remember that this process will probably kill me if it doesn’t calm down. My renunciation of this society was a great blessing, afterall. I realized that people liked me again, despite that I had these strange phenomenon occurring within me. I always felt liked and accepted for most of my existence and I feel that this social acceptance gave me the confidence to be okay with myself and begin to explore new territories of inner being. I felt more at home in a hardware store than in a closed-minded spiritual society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My meditation experiences came back with even more intensity and originality. I gradually developed my own system of practice. Throughout these years I never stopped having dreams of Anandamurti in which he always told me very interesting clues. He never gave anything away, but rather just guided me towards the understanding of spiritual practice. I realized that I didn’t even need to meditate anymore but that Anandamurti continued to give me experiences that would deepen my understanding of meditation. It has been a great adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this time, I became friends with Pluma Blanca, a Mayan yogi from Campeche. On our first meetings he shared his insights about the Tree Tantra. He always sat in meditation under the ceiba tree. It reminded me of how Anandamurti said that it is good to meditate under the neem tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One takes the tree as a symbol for meditation while at the same time taking actual shelter under the tree and participating with its shield of electromagnetic&lt;wbr /&gt; energy while meditating.  According to Mayan mystics “nothing evil can happen while under the ceiba.”  The upward force growing out of the earth helps awaken the kundalini while the downward force of converting air into mass and developing deep roots into the earth helps bring the kundalini back down. Mind must fly upward toward the spirit but also must return to the earth, at least for as long as one is on this earth. Just like the Indian Yogis, Pluma Blanca said that a yogi completes his spiritual practice by bringing the kundalini back down, from the crown and back down into the spiritual heart. This gives a base for the mind mid-way along the spinal column. One can be joyfully engaged in existence here while remaining in a subtle state of being while at the same time keep oneself grounded and in the body. Like the great ceiba tree, one extends high into the heavens while also rooting oneself deep into the earth. Unchecked kundalini force will eventually liberate you but it can kill your body if not careful. One gets attached to spiritual bliss and experiences but must know how to balance them out. It is better to save that intensity for when it is really time to leave all work and thereby the physical body, and never before then. Like the Upanishad says, “Desire to live 100 years while working in joyful unity with Brahma.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-few-stories-of-dada-iishvarakrsnananda&quot;&gt;A Few Stories of Dada Iishvarakrsnananda&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dada Iishvarakrsnananda or “Dada I.K.” was my meditation and yoga teacher when I was in Ananda Marga. He was the most humane and friendly person I have ever known. I continue to admire his moral courage and feel that his sincerity, discernment, and pure intentions are a great inspiration for many. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a story he wrote the other day. Its setting is in an intense political atmosphere in India after Anandamurti had refused to stop speaking about PROUT, a decentralized economic theory that he propounded. The communists in the West Bengal state government are attacking Anandamurti and killing his followers while at the same time the Federal, pro-capitalist government is also trying to ban his social activity. PROUT was too transcendental for both the commie state and the Federal pro-capitalist governments and Anandamurti was getting flack from both the Right as well as the Left. Anandamurti’s institution, Ananda Marga Pracaraka Samgha, was later infiltrated by the CBI (which is like the CIA, only Indian). Many of his closest disciples betrayed him while others, like my friend Iishvarakrsnananda, went to jail in his teenage years for refusing to renounce these ideas even though he would have been given a presidential pardon and release for doing so. Many of his friends were brutally tortured and he himself almost died in jail but never renounced his principles. I have never known men with such clarity of purpose as I have known in Dada I.K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I Still Love Them”.  -Acarya Iishvarakrsnanada Avadhuta&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Baba asked me if I had any questions. I had a question in my mind that had haunted me for around 15 years or more. But I was always afraid to talk to Baba. Either I forget that question or I was too afraid to talk whenever I met Baba personally. The question was not very good. But that day Baba was in very very happy mood and told me that I can ask any question to Him. I got some courage to ask the question. The question has made me very angry and upset. For some time I would jump out of the bed due to anger and hatred towards some sanyasi dadas who went against Baba and put Him in Jail. Sometimes my blood was boiling with anger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told Baba: “I went to Jail before you went to jail.” At the time I was taking care Baba’s quarter in 1971 in Ranchi. I was LFT (Local Full-time Worker) at that time. I was also Baba’s body guard. When Baba left for Patna after Ananda purnima Dharma maha chakra I was travelling with Baba to Patna by security jeep. However, in last minute I was asked to take care of Baba’s quarters in Ranchi along with a few other volunteers. So I came down from the Jeep . It was very painful for me to be separated from Baba. After a month of the departure of Baba the police arrested 33 Margis (members of Ananda Marga), LFTs and WTs (Whole Time workers), all on false charges. Madhvananda and 14 other sanyasi dadas were with us during the arrest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Question to Baba continued, “did the CBI did not know about you as Dharma guru? Those dadas had seen the power of spirituality, demonstration, and power of Taraka Brahma. Those dadas told me many spiritual stories about you. Those same Dadas went against you and made false accusations against you. When I think about those Dadas my blood boils with anger.” When Baba listened to my words, He became totally peaceful. There was total silence. I never have felt such a silence in my life. It was total peace. He held my both of my hands for a long period. He remained in silence for quite a bit of time and then He told me that “I still love them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of my anger, hatred, and frustration was gone since that day. Baba used to say that Paramapurusa (Supreme Consciousness) cannot hate anyone. He repeated this several times in his talks: “Oh human being! what right do we have to hate anyone when almighty Taraka Brahma does not hate any one?”
Baba used to say that “you may like or dislike someone. But do not hate anyone.” Baba was Parama Purusha, Taraka Brahma, and Satguru. Baba was a symbol of love. Baba is a symbol of love. Baba will be a symbol of love. Baba came here to flood the earth with love. Let all of His children work for spreading love. Love will unite us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE POWER OF MANTRA AND THE POWER OF GURU  Dada Iishvarakrsnananda&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I wrote about a saintly Grhii Acarya (Married, Family Teacher), Sakal Deva.
Today I am writing about a serious incident which forced him to join Ananda Marga.
Acaraya Sakal Deva Dada was a fearless person. He was lawyer by profession . His body was well built . I did not have a chance to see him in his younger adult age but even at the age of 90 he used to walk in an erect position. Before he was in Ananda Marga, people were a bit afraid of him. He was bit rough and tough with people. He was not afraid of any one or anything. One day he was walking on the road . He saw a person in a black robe. After seeing the person, he became afraid. He was haunted by fear day and night after that . He went to temples and other religious places to overcome his fear. The lawyer who was known as fearless in Muzaffarpur had become full of fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one rainy day, he started to run and fell down and was knocked unconscious. Some so-called low cast people in Bihar saw him lying unconscious and brought him near a temple. Somehow these local people knew about Ananda Marga tantric meditation practice in that area. They told him that Ananda Marga meditation will help you. He got the address of an acarya and went to see him but he could not find him there. The family of the Acarya gave the address of another Grhi acarya. He visited him. The Grhi Acarya was very lean and thin person . He wanted to overcome fear at any cost. He wanted to learn meditation but he put some strict conditions on his Acarya. His first condition was that he loves to drink whisky every day. He must be allowed to drink whisky as he will die without drinking whisky. He also eats meat at every meal. He must be allowed to eat meat every day. I forgot his third demand. The Grhi Acarya was a bit nervous. Sakaldev dada told me that to overcome his fear he wanted to learn sadhana (meditation) even if he were to have to force the acharya to teach him if the acharya would not have agreed to teach willingly. He would have easily overpowered him because the acharya was so thin. He was adamant to learn meditation. Finally Sakaladeva dada was taught meditation.. The Family Acarya told him that you may drink your whisky and eat meat every day, but you must practice meditation twice a day as well.
In the Ananda Marga meditation system, the Guru teaches meditation and the acarya is just a medium. Now the job was taken over by the Guru. The power of his mantra started to work.
After few days of sincere practice of Sadhana as per instruction of his Acarya, he went to eat his meat. Afterward, he kept vomitiing and vomiting. The same thing happened with his desire for whisky. When he went to drink whisky he broke the bottle with his bare hands out of repulsion for the whisky.
He gave up eating meat and drinking whisky. He told me that when he went to court, he would always drink whisky before making arguments in the court.. Such was situation of Acarya Sakal Deva Dada before becoming a margii.. Acarya Sakaldeva Dada took the shelter of Varabahaya (the blessing of fearlessness from the guru) and all fear went away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spiritual Journey and Struggle: Part 3  -Dada Iishvarakrsnananda&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were a half dozen people in the training center. I was youngest of the trainees. We learned some basic philosophy, worker’s rules, etc. After the training we had to do SPT (Sadhana Piitha Training). We got a piece of cloth to wrap around us but no slippers, no shirt, no shoes.
We had to keep silence( Maona Brata) .We were not allowed to keep any money or any kind of possession. We were instructed to go to beg door to door in the morning and come back before noon. It was very hard thing for me; but I had no choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to go far away from the town; so that no known person should notice me.
One day I went very far away to the tribal village. I had collected some potatoes and rice. I used to utter 3 times “Hari Om Tat Sat” . If they gave me alms; I took them, otherwise, I moved to the next house. I was not supposed to talk and a say any words if some one asks me except “Hari Om Tat Sat” while I was begging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day I was walking on a road when I met a man. He wanted to talk to me, but I refused to talk with him. He continued and forced me to talk. I explained a little bit about Ananda Marga.
He told me that there is gathering where around 50 people are sitting.
“It will be nice if you come there and talk to them about your philosophy,” he told me.
I did not want to go there, but he forcefully persuaded me to go there. I was alone and there was no one else on the street. So I followed him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at the gathering people were sitting in a court yard and drinking tribal liquor and in the other side some ritual was going on. I wanted to leave the place and I told the person who had brought me there. He told me that he can not do anything as the Sardar ( head of the tribe) is responsible for this place. He told me to speak with the Sardar . I asked permission from head of tribe to leave. The Sardar told me that “you were brought here as a sacrifice to our Goddess. You can not leave this place.” I was surrounded by many people and I started to cry on the inside. The Dadas had told me that if there is any problem that I should use second lesson of meditation. I started to take second lesson, but the mantra did nothing. I was confused, but I did not cry. I was remembering Baba, but it did not work. I started to think that I will be killed and offered to the goddess and no one will know about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complete memory of my life started to come back. Every one used to love me. All my family members were so close to me. For some time I was thinking about my father, sometimes about my mother, sometimes about my brothers, sisters, and sister-in-laws. Before becoming a Margii everyone loved me so much. I thought about my nephew and niece and how I used to play with them. I started to think that my family was right. I should not have joined Ananda Marga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will die and no one will know. No mantra, no Baba, no God was going to help me. I was a heart-broken man. Death without reason was meaningless. Every second I was thinking about death. I had lost all hope in God, Guru, Mantra, tantra. I was just thinking about my death every second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had reached there around 8 AM. Almost eight hours had passed there. They were chanting and sharping some axe and sword. I was watching and counting my time. Next they brought some home-made tribal liqueur called “handia”.
I never had any kind of alcohol in my life. I refused it but they wanted to drug me. I was helpless. Four people came and some one held my hand, then some one opened my mouth and kept pouring liquor in my mouth. I did not know how many bottles they put inside me as I was half dead. They brought some rice to feed me but I refused, so again forcibly they put rice in my mouth and I somehow swallowed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to express my feeling about this unwanted death as I had lost all hope.
I had some potatos in my begging bag. One person came and snatched my bag. He told me that he wanted to eat my potato. I gave it to him. Then somebody appeared out of nowhere. He told the man who was going to eat my potato: “do not touch that potato”. He further said: “do not take food from a beggar. This person may be saint, a swami, or god on the earth. If you take his things then I will smash your head.” The person who was going to take my potatos asked him: “who are you?” He replied: “that it is none of your business.” While this was going on a riot broke out. People were very drunk and they started to beat each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unknown person who had appeared told me: “run away from here!,” but I had no energy to move. I was scared to death of the sharp axe and sword. The thought of death was moving through my head as they can kill me at any time. I did not move. The person again shouted: “run away from here!” In the end he came to me, grabbed my hand and we started to run. I was still afraid that they would follow me. We ran and ran until we came to the main road. This person told me: “Go, go to Baba.” Additionally, he said: “I will be here until you reach your place. If any one comes here I am going to chop off their heads one by one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was almost dark when I reached my place. Dada Shyamananada was moving back and forth in front of Baba’s gate. When he saw me he became very angry. He was very upset. He told me that Baba have not taken food and water since the morning. He has told them if his son does not come He will not eat and drink. I told Dada to go and tell Baba that I am back and that I will narrate the whole story.
He went to tell the news to Baba. After a few minutes Dada came back and told that the food and water which was for Baba has to be given to me. “That is instruction of Baba, there will be no prasad today,” Dada told me.I had wonderful meal. I once told this story to Baba when Baba had asked me how many times he has directly or indirectly helped me. This story was written during Baba’s life in Hindi and later translated into English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I GAVE THAT POWER ONLY TO YOU narrated by Dada Iishvarakrsnananda&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had written in a previous story that Baba had given power to Dada Dasaratha to screen people to have personal contact. Dada Dasaratha used to see the mental color of people and accordingly he used to either reject or send the people for personal contact. Once a very important person came to Jamalpur to have Personal contact.. He was sent to Dada Dasaratha for screening. Dada Dasratha entered his mind and saw the person was unfit for personal contact and so he rejected the person for personal contact. However, some top official of Ananda Marga started to put pressure on Dada Dasaratha to approve the person who was very, very important. Dada was in a dilemma. On one e side were top officials of Marga and othere side was Baba’s instruction. Finally, Dada Dasaratha went to see Baba. He told the whole incident. Baba was furious., He told Dada Dasaratha that I gave that power to you only to decide. Nobody else. Do not have to listen to any one. In the end Mr. very, very important person did not get personal contact at that time. Baba was a great master that he did not differentiate between so called important people in society and an ordinary person. His rule was the same for everyone. That was his greatness. Glory to Lord Shrii Ananda Murti Jii.Param pita baba ki Jay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I WAS NOT ABLE TO FIND SOMEONE TO PLAY THIS DIFFICULT ROLE” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;It was the year 1987 and I had came from Hong Kong sector to attend Ananda Purnima Dharma Mahacakar. and RDS. I had a very good news report. I was very excited. Most of the central Dadas were happy about my good news report. But when Baba came to take report from usI was singled out by for for poor productivity. Two other Dadas were also singled out. For poor productivity a punishment was given. Negative microvita were put in certain part of body. The first day Baba made some commenst which I did not like. He asked all the Dadas to keep away from me. No one was allowed to be with me and some were taunting. Some were allowed to make bad comment. Some people were scolding for poor out turn. It was big drama. I felt much pain from the negative microvita which were making my whole mind negative. The next day again was same drama: shouting, scolding, making fun. Taunting, etc. My mind was becoming very negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the third day when Baba ask me to touch the feet of all Dadas and Didis. I did. I was asked to give a talk . Baba told me to give a talk on the effects of negative microvita. He also told me that to tell people that if they will not work for Marga then they will get negative microvita and suffer tremendously. It was a very difficult situation for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baba also said that I gave many talks in South Korea. In a similar I should give a talk and convince everybody present to work for Marga, otherwise they will also get the application of negative microvita. My mind had became negative but I gave a talk although I was in pain. I almost became mad. RDS was over. We all went back to our place. I was staying in the Upper hostel. Around 1 AM SHUBHABUDDHANANDA.JI(VSS SG) and KRSNATMANANDA woke me up without saying a word. They put me in Jeep and I became afraid. They brought me Baba’s Quarter in Ananda Nagar. I kept thinking the last three days that Baba has been informed wrongly about me. GS dada was lying on the floor in front of Baba’s Door. GS Dada was sleeping. He woke up from sleep and told me that I have been transferred from Hong Kong sector to Manila sector in Bali (Indonesia). He then said to go back to sleep. After that they brought me back to upper hostel. I went to sleep. After Dharma Maha cakra and RDS the meetings were over. I went back to Kolkata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to meet Baba personally. I request Dada Keshavananda who was Personal Assistant to Baba to get permission to see him, which I eventually did. My mind was still very very negative when I got the approval, but I became a little happy. I entered in to Baba’s room and did sastaunga pranam to Baba and got up. Baba asked about the good news from Hong Kong sector. I started to tell the good news. Baba became very upset and I was asked to leave the room and I left the room Immediately. I was totally shocked, pained, disturbed and confused. The question started to come in my mind about this “good news.” When I came out of the room many dada asked me about my meeting with Baba. I told them that Baba said nothing to me in very angry mood whenever they asked me.
I became very restless and sad. This was worst test given by a Tantric Guru.
I was walking like a mad man in the Lake Gardens. One dada came to me and told me that Baba wanted to see me again. I told him that I do not want to see Baba. I was thinking Baba was going to punish me again. I saw Dada Keshavananda was running towards me. He asked me to go to see Baba. I told him that I do not want to see Baba. My Mind had become totally negative but he grabbed my hand and dragged me and threw me into Baba’s room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I went in to his room Baba was in Kalyan Sundram Mudra . He said to approach him. His voice was so sweet . It is hard to explain in words. Baba said,
“I was not able to find anybody to play this difficult role. You did it best. I have to teach people. You have had to undergo much suffering in this RDS. Come closer and sing me a song.” All of my negativity and the effects of the negative microvita were gone. I was in a different world and different mood. I sang a song but it was not Prabhat samgiita. It was song of the 60’s that I had learned in Dharma cakra when I became a Margii in 1967. I liked the song very much. It was a popular song. I realized I made a big blunder when I came out of His room. I should have sung Prabhat Samgiita. But when you have become mind less, when you do not have your own mind, then you can not decide wrong or right.
Most importantly Baba did not objected when I sang the other song in place of Prabhat samgiita. It was very important for me to see Baba in the Kalyan Sundram Mudra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE GURU’S ORDER MUST BE FOLLOWED &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 5th,1967 five Dadas were murdered in Ananda Nagar by a communist inspired mob. Baba made a committee of five members to meet Jyoti Bashu who was then home minister of West Bengal. It was a united front government ruled by Bangla Congress, a breakaway group of the national Congress Party and the Marxist Communist Party. Our five members were sent to meet the home minister, including Acarya Lalan who was the first principal of our Ananda Nagar Degree College. When they went to meet Jyoti Basu, the home minister, they were not allowed to meet him and reported back to Baba. Baba asked a question to them. “Did all committee members go to see Jyoti Basu?” The committee members replied, “we all went except Acarya Sakaldeva.” Baba was a bit upset. He said we must take Acarya Sakaldevaji with you. They all again went to see Jyoti Basu to submit the memorandum. As per instruction of Baba All went to see Jyoti Basu.They were allowed to meet him this time. They had earlier violated the instruction of Guru by not bringing Acarya Sakaldeva and that is why they were not allowed to see Jyoti Basu.
The reason for removing Acarya Sakaladevaji from group to see Jyoti Basu was due to some kind of complex in the mind of the committee members. Acarya Sakaldev Dev Dada had very simple dress. He was very simple looking person, although by profession he was a lawyer. He was a family Acaraya (Grihi Acarya). All others were well-dressed. Acaray Sakala Deva is no longer on this earth. He was the acarya of Acarya Svarupananda Avadhuat, Acarya Sujiit Kumarji, and Acarya Nirmohananda Avadhuta, among others. He remained in Ananda Marga and kept working for the Legal Department until his death. He was a saintly and very sweet-natured person. He was great devotees of Baba. He spent some time with me in Delhi Baba’s quarter when I broke my leg in 1999. I also spent time in south ex Delhi Jagrti. when ever I went to India. I always had wonderful Satsanga with him. He is grand father of Prasenjitji who is working with a university in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;celibates-and-sexuality&quot;&gt;Celibates and Sexuality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is so much suffering caused by blind sexuality.  So many women are abandoned with children by men whose animal instincts soon pull them elsewhere after a little sensory gratification.  The trail of trauma for the woman may continue as she must struggle to care for the child that have been abandoned.  Or perhaps it was her unfulfilled or frustrated desires that caused the separtion to begin with.  One thing is certain, and it is that there are fewer and fewer examples of harmonious co-existence in human sexual-emotional affairs.  As a culture we have gone back into the stone age as regards to sexuality; only we don’t have giraffs and rhinoceros to chase and hunt down in order to channelize this energy and give us some relief.  Instead there is emerging a whole culture of permissiveness and even indulgence.  In truth, this distortion of the sexual tendency leaves many with very little happiness remaining in marriage or interpersonal relationships.  Conversely, I see very little hope in “free love” and open relationships as well.  While some like the way it sounds in theory, I have always seen that somebody always ends up getting hurt.  What we need is love.  Sexuality doesn’t necessarily have to ruin this but it usually does if one or both people lack insight into what emotive factors are really driving them deep within.  And it is only by going deep within and seeing these needs that one can find fulfillment in sexuality and relationships.  Very few people can altogether transcend these needs.  These people are very rare and very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a very normal sexual orientation in my youth.  Nothing was too extreme, neither repression or expression.  I had everything I needed to live a happy family life by the time I was finishing the university:  a good companion, a good education, and strong adademic interests that inspired future plans.  However, I discovered meditation and yoga in my second to last year,and then got initiated into a very serious tantric practice.  The next thing I knew I was single, just barely graduated the university due to lack of interest, and was on my way to India to find more truth.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was surprising to see how my sexuality began to diminish as I cultivated these practics.  I was still a normal heterosexual; everything still worked, only the fire had died down a little.  The fire was now kindling the desire for deeper spiritual experience.  In those days yoga was still a weird Asian or hippy thing, and not the popular practice that it has become today.  I knew nothing of contemporary yoga.  Fortunately, I learned from some very sincere and serious practitioners from India whom I met at the university.  I was beginning to understand what these older yogis had told me:  that with meditation there is deep insight and this deep insight into the mind and emotions helps one understand not just sex but all mental and biological tendencies.  Tantra Yoga was for me a “libidinal economy,” a way of investing energy in other pursuits.  If you put energy in place B, then it is no longer in place A, the original place. As a psychology student I was very well aware with the concepts of suppression and repression and the illnesses and neurosis that they cause.  Transmutation was a different idea, however.  I never studied this in school.  Freud certainly didn’t grasp this idea.  Perhaps Jung and the humanists did, however.  What impressed me most about Tantra Yoga wasn’t elaborate, sophisticated theories, but the practical results of converting physical desire into mental desire.  And sure enough, my intellectual capacity exploded the more I practiced yoga and meditation and put on the laungota, the yogis loincloth.  Surely you have seen them; the “Tarzan apparatus,” or “organic chastity belt.”  My mind became so sharp, however I was no longer interested in intellectual pursuits.  All that mattered was finding the source of what was summoning me to make all sorts of renunciations that I never thought possible.  Maybe there was some difficulty in the beginning when I was still in the university surrounded by shapely co-eds.  However, for the most part it was a very sweet renunciation with promises of something greater.  I didn’t scorn sexuality.  That would be a direct path to a repressive hell.  I just knew that there was something greater.  The awakening of the kundalini is more bliss than a thousand physical orgasms at once.  And the lover in this tryst is Infinite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem that I had with my new life-style is that I began to become very sensitive to the environment around me.  I began to feel people very deeply.  For example, instead of noticing that somebody was sad by the tone of their voice or facial expression, I began to feel their state of mind.  I would see somebody from far away on campus and get an impression about their state of mind.  What was especially difficult was when I had to share a room with another person.  I always dreamed of their inner life.  I shared my dreams with them and they were really grateful for the insight into their issues.  I once dreamed that I was in a love affair with a girl from Vermont.  We met together in a barn and….  When I awoke I was perturbed because I hadn’t even thought of sex for several months.  I asked myself “why Vermont?  What do I have to do with Vermont?  I remembered that my room-mate was from Vermont.  I asked him if he had a lover there recently.  He just snickered and said, “you caught me!”  I was always very sociable.  However this new energetic sensitivity began to isolate me a little.  However, I had already decided that I wanted to be a monk and accepted this solitary yet blissful position in life.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time I graduated and arrived in India I was having very intense kundalini experiences.  Nobody understood me except my mother and a few close friends.  That soon changed when I arrived at Ananda Nagar.  I felt like I had arrived at a very special learining institution.  It reminded me a little of Hesse’s “The Glass Bead Game” only these men were mystics instead of intellectuals.  They did practical work as well.  The yogi whom I spoke of in last week’s essay administrated a university in the day and meditated all through the night.  It was good to have a reference for work because I had only spiritual desires and didn’t want to do anything else. He was a very advanced meditator and passed through spiritual passions that lasted several years in which he did very little work on the physical plane.  Instead, he was absorbed in the bliss of samadhi.  It is not that he was useless in these times.  Quite the contrary, his elevated vibration inspired many, but also made his little monastic brothers a little jealous of his spiritual achievements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This monk had told me his secrets of transmuting sexual desire on one of our first encounters. He said that he never repressed anything.  I could see that this was true as he was very outspoken.  He openly criticized the crusty theocracy around him and told me with a hearty laugh that Ananda Marga would probably end up killing their own saints some day. He was bold and always expressed himself openly, especially when stubborn or dogmatic people needed a little kick in the rear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He expressed his ideas about sexuality in a similar manner.  If a women’s breasts appeared in his mind during meditation, he just let it happen.  He knew it was impermanent.  He would struggle with the image in his mind, then let his mind enjoy the form.  He still continued to do his meditation during these intrusive “fantasies.”  Slowly his state of formless bliss would return.  He said that eventually he would feel compassion for this person and felt that if this desire manifested he could really harm another person emotionally because he was so god-intoxicated.  He knew that these were momentary inclinations  and that for him to take a lover would be a disastrous existential manuever.  This inspired him to embrace her within a radiant white light and to tell her she was dear to the divine and that he would never harm her.  He said that in the end he always saw his “lover” merging into the pure light of the eternal Atman, and returned to his peaceful meditations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What he told me weren’t some exact, specific techniques to make a desire disapper.  Rather it is an attitude and way of life in general that works to transform the mind and body with their desires.  Few people understand the deep reasons for spiritual discipline and what the yogi truly wants to achieve.  This monk was a robust, intelligent, and even handsome person.  He would have had no trouble impressing the ladies.  He was a far cry from the creepy, repressed preist that negates himself through repression and thereby degenerates his libido into dark perversions.  I truly believe he had developed the “heroic” state of meditation in which there remain very few desires and one thereby begins to let go of all inhibitions.  “All things come from god, how can anything harm me?”  Althought this is the attitude of the “heroic” yogi, it is also the motto of the sensualist who loses his/herself in these very same tendencies. Very few people can really become detached from desire without butchering themselves up on the inside with repressions and distortions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I attach some of my writings from A Name to the Nameless related to this subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sexual Tantra&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I have got your attention!   When speaking about the second, or svadhistana vortex, most people immediately think of sexuality.  The six vrttis or vortexes of the svadhistana vortex are indifference, depression, compulsion, lack of confidence, paranoia, and resentment.  These 6 tendencies have more to do with a lack of sound grounding in one’s person rather than just sexuality.  The sexual drive is rooted in the sensory mind, in the first vortex.  The problem is that due to a lack of awareness of one’s emotional and physical needs, the sexual desire often gets confounded with these defense mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is quite natural and healthy that the sex instinct of the sensory mind finds higher expressions in higher centers.  In a balanced second vortex the sex drive hasn’t reached its full maturity but still is not a blind animal instinct.  It has more to do with emotional security, which is the constant theme when discussing the svadhistana vortex.  The problem is that this biological instinct gets tangled up in the distortions and insecurities of the svadhistana, self-conceptual mind. The ego begins to exploit this gratification for its unconscious necessities and there is always suffering and degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never taken the so-called “sexual tantra” seriously.  Firstly, because the only people who I have ever known to practice such things were never really balanced.  Sure, they spoke of awareness and love and transmutation and all of those nice things, but it was just all too obvious that they were just sex addicts propelled by unconscious emotions.  They always left a trail of harm.  It may be that there were once some more conscious practices that really didn’t trap people into their compulsions, but if they were in fact truthful, then would have to be based on yama and niyama, the ethical base for the practice of yoga.  Most sexual relations ultimately lead one to suffering.  It is a transgression of ahimsa, or no-violence, to project one’s selfish urges onto another.  It is no wonder that in the 2 languages that I understand, the crude word for the sexual act can be  synonymous with the words cheating, deceiving, or generally harming another.
The only functional sexual tantra that I have ever known is to first be responsible and never try to harm anyone while at the same time make the indefatigable effort to try and understand the propensities of the second vortex.  The sexual distortions exploit these fundamental vrttis.  The more suffering, separation, and insecurity that there is in the svadhistana level, the more likely that sexuality will try and compensate for these emotions.    However, these necessities are valid and are so profound and fundamental to the personality that they really need to be understood.  Perhaps the blind compulsions are due to an untimely withdrawal of a mother’s breast that left one sucking in nothingness.  Or perhaps sexuality has aligned itself with an inner, unconscious resentment and lack of confidence that tries to outwardly seduce and dominate through sexual dominance, games, or manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have come to think that when there is no suffering, there is no desire, and where there is no desire, there is no suffering.  This is true for all desires, not just sex.  Few people can really understand this.  Ramakrishna once said that mundane pleasure is like a dog chewing a sharp bone and doesn’t realize the “satiation” of this desire comes from its own blood.  It is fear and insecurity that keep us bound into the limitation of a separate self, and therefore bound to selfish desires.  Sometimes, even very highly developed minds overlook these underlying reverberations in the shadows of the emotions.  The pirates to our present state of bliss are often something unseen from our past.  I have found that the study of the vrttis, especially those of the svadhistana, are paramount for finding the psychological balance that permits intuitive, spiritual development.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;In part 1 I spoke of my experiences with a very wise and pure yogi regarding sexuality.  The following account is the perfect opposite of what this great man taught.  It will help give us perspective on what is actually successful transmutation of an instinct as compared to what is simply repression and distortion that only further exacerbates and excites an instinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once heard a conversation in which a certain high-ranking member of Ananda Marga, Karunananda, was speaking of how he was once an administrative boss of many monastics.  He didn’t know what to do about their sexual repression.  He said the only solution was to find hookers for them.  He had a regular brothel going on.  This was while he was in Hong Kong.  Later, I also heard of rumors that he also had one of these establishments for the big whig central acharyas at Ananda Nagar.  When I heard this I could not mentally process the information.  I had been so close to many saintly monks and had such great respect for Ananda Marga that I simply couldn’t register this new, dissonant information in my head.  My ears heard it without a doubt, but my mind didn’t know what to do with the new information.  It was clearly the strongest case of cognitive dissonance that I ever experienced.  I probably would have suppressed this information, distorted it, or have made up an excuse if it had not been for my friend who spoke to me about this shock a few minutes later.  He was present for the conversation too and was a little more mature in the ways of the world than I.  He didn’t have any problem scoffing at this.  I, on the other hand, was struggling to assimilate it all.  Seeing all of those central monks  coming to visit him every day gave me the greatest suspicions.  “If he does this, then is everybody else doing it too?  Are all of these high-ranking monks clients in his brothel? “Does this mean all of Ananda Marga could all be a lie?”  These were the voices inside of me that I didn’t want to hear.  A month later was the famous Purulia Arms Drop in which Ananda Marga monks tried to pull off an international arms deal.  It failed miserably and I, because I was in the wrong place at the wrong time, found myself imprisoned, then put under house arrest while our case was scheduled for the Indian Supreme Court.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just after the arms drop Karunananda kicked me out of the hostel where I was staying because I was under surveillance and he was also guilty of helping this failed scheme and didn’t want the police anywhere near him. I could see the fear in his eyes that revealed his complicity.  He was terrified of me and didn’t want me near him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chidghananda, one of the great acharyas and early disciples of Anandamurti, became my closest guide as well as best friend.  He accepted me into the hostel he managed the night Karunananda had booted me out.  There was also a big commotion going on that night.  The locals were beating on drums and the monks thought they were war drums.  All of the monks were in a panic to escape to the train station.  They thought there would be another massacre by the communists who gave money, alcohol and weapons to the locals to attack the Ananda Marga ashram.  Chidghananda just told me to lock the door and meditate all night.  If I die I will go happy, he said with a sweet smile.  It was his way of saying all will be fine.  I had just met him before this incident. He went to jail voluntarily with me so as to protect me from the forces that had me trapped in a situation in which I had no understanding.  He was concerned that we would be tortured like the monks who were tortured by the police on several earlier occasions.  This was the best experience of my life, spending long hours meditating with this great yogi, in jail and later under 6 months of house arrest while our case was passing through the Indian Supreme Court.  Although his mind was deeply connected with the Supreme Consciousness through his spiritual practice, he was always the most simple yet highly rational person.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chidghananda once told me the most incredible story.  Several years earlier Anandmurti once was speaking about microvita and explained that only Taraka Brahma (the Supreme Consciounes acting as Liberator) can cause a sex to change without an operation or drugs.  It is possible to change sex with the application of microvita, he explained.  At the same time Karunananda began to beg Anandamurti to not turn him into a woman.  He sat their crying and saying that he felt a change in his organs and that he was becoming a “lady.”  “Baba, please don’t make me a lady!,” he cried.  Was this spectacle a “jedi mind trick” of a humorous, loving guru giving a scolding his rascally, macho disciple, or the special powers of Taraka Brahma?  Who really knows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chidghananda was too serious about such things to spread gossip.  I think he was trying to tell us all something.  It has a little something to do with the law of opposites, of Heraclitian enantiodromia drama.  When one goes a little too far with any form of machismo, whether physical, mental, or spiritual, the opposite, repressed and distorted force finds a way to crack the surface of one’s near-psychotic, one-sided mind and forces a radical change.   “Okay macho man, now try being a woman,” is what the law of karma wants to teach them.  This may explain all of the bizzare sexual distortions with the monks nowadays.  The cover of so many of these leaders has been blown.  When younger monks lose respect for their elders, they lose faith in their own capacities as well.  It is much easier to fall when one loses one’s confidence.  Nature, or Prakrti, doesn’t let it slide, however.  This kind of abuse causes very strong reactions.  Sexuality is a very delicate energy and to damage it or cause distortions or harm has very intense consequences.  These monks later have to live duplicitous lives and perhaps develop perversions and extreme indulgences because of this repression and distortion that escapes with a wild madness.  It is much saner to live a normal, family life.  It is difficult to straighten out these libido knots once they are established.  One may not finish working them out in one life-time. One is perhaps reborn with all kinds of complexes, homosexuality, or sexual identification problems.  I believe Anandamurti showed Karunananda this law of opposites to try to get him to change course.  He knew that if he continued with his machismo, then he would harm others and himself.  “If he can fall, then what about me?,” is what most of us would think.  &lt;/p&gt;

I saw the first images of carnage during the first Gulf War my last year in high school.  I was disgusted and ashamed. Although most of the teachers and leaders in society were supporting the government propaganda of a justified attack, there were also a few dissenters in the public school system who gave alternative views.  I had been influenced by one such teacher.  I really had no strong political views but I learned just enough of modern politics to entirely mistrust our government.  At the same time a giant boil appeared on my cheek.  It was enormous and swollen and very embarrassing.  As the fluid oozed out all I could think about were the images of the bodies of the hotel clerks in Bhagdad who were killed by misguided guided missiles.  I was ashamed to be an American.  No more John Wayne and heroic Green Berets saving the day; just filthy rotten imperialists and duped, flag-waving morons robbing and murdering weaker societies for their natural resources.  Well, for several years at least I vacillated between that extreme definition of my countrymen or the definition that they are also victims exploited by bad education and capitalist pseudo-culture. Either way, fascism always ends up taking hold of empires in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, for several years at least I vacillated between that extreme definition of my countrymen or the idea that they are also victims exploited by bad education and capitalist pseudo-culture.  Either way, fascism always ends up taking hold of empires just before their demise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the second invasion of Iraq in the spring of 2003 the boil returned in exactly the same place.  It was like a malevolent spirit that still haunted me.  I was no longer ashamed of being an American because I had become a universal citizen by then.  I really saw us as no more different than the German population around the time of Hitler.  However, I still had those same feelings of disgust with the mindless American populace that unwittingly goes along with the plans of the military industrial complex, bankers and politicians that make all of this profitable war business and propaganda possible.  More than just a rebellious attitude against authority, it was rather an attitude that these worms have no right to inflict this terror on any human being, especially when the justifications for aggression are based on crude lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had just moved to Mexico in 2003 and met a young couple who were very concerned about the war.  They were intelligent, educated, and had a very humanistic outlook.  They had a new-born baby at the time and were a very happy family. However, they were horrified at how the United States was so blatantly pulling off this scheme that any reasonable intelligent person unbiased by Fox or CBS could clearly see through.    The wife seemed to be deeply affected by the of war and was becoming even more so as time went on.  Although I don’t think they were actively protesting in the streets, I did hear of them attending some social and ceremonial gatherings of a pacific nature.  Slowly she began to become depressed and withdrawn.  Nobody heard from her anymore.  There was a Summer Solstice meditation event soon afterwards in which we heard from other friends that she had become very depressed, would not talk to anybody and was hardly even interested in caring for her baby.  Her husband was very worried and did not understand what was happening to her.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She arrived and gave a faint smile to everyone.  I hardly recognized her.  There seemed to be nobody at home.  My wife took her into a back room of the clinic away from all of the people participating in the festival in order to talk with her and give her some naturopathic treatments.  I could see her husband was very concerned and was having to give a lot of time helping to care for the baby.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About an hour later I was called back into the room.  My wife asked me to touch the crown of her head.  She asked me if I could feel something strange.  I did so and felt a terrible, evil presence.  It was similar to the feeling I had with my boil but much, much stronger.  I knew that this was an evil too powerful to be coming from her.  It was like a giant, super-personal plasma blob of evil that was in the room.  I felt sick and went into the next room to lie down.  Ten minutes later my wife came in and said her patient was feeling much better.  By that time I had already begun to decipher what was affecting her.  My wife saw that I was abnormal and asked me if I absorbed something.  I replied that I believe I had.  My heart was pounding as if I had run a marathon.  I could distinctly feel another presence inside of me.  I had never felt like there was some other being existing inside me before.  Yes, maybe I had had some strange experiences with deeper parts of my existence but it was always an experience with the various aspects of my own self.  My wife immediately lost her non-attachment as a healer and began to worry about me.  She wanted to take me to the hospital, which was quite ironic because she always “stole” patients from hospitals before the butchers took people’s organs out.  She was crying and begging me not to die.  I laughed and told her to shut up because I am fighting for my life with all of my force and the last thing I need is for my doctor to say I am going to die!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lied there all night listening to the suggestions of this dark entity.  I knew it was either it or I that would be alive in the morning.  Fortunately, my life was very full and vibrant and I didn’t accept any of the suggestions from this evil.  It was like a pattern that simply made everything negative and distorted-  pessimistic and destructive thoughts, hateful feelings, while at the same time it siphoned the life out of the body.  It was a contest to see which mental pattern would control this body, the evil plasma or my own conscience.  I could now understand very well what was affecting our friend and her family.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few hours I recovered a little.  The woman had fallen asleep and I went to speak with her husband.  I was exhausted but said that I believe everything will now be alright.  He seemed a little relieved.  I awoke with a terrible headache.  It stayed with me a week or so while this presence was being digested.  In the meantime the family learned meditation and we spent much time with the baby and all was alright.  It was the most terribly illuminating experience I had ever had up until that point in my life.  It was the beginning of a live microvita study that has only gotten wilder as the years pass on.&lt;/p&gt;

Fear is certainly the most prominent feeling that pervades human life. Much that was said about fear of annihilation at the Svadhistana Vortex is relevant to this vrtti in the 3rd vortex. Just as many of the foundational tendencies of the 2nd vortex are translated and transmuted into the expansive and vigorous tendencies of the 3rd,  fear a more complex and conscious form of the pervasive fear of annihilation. Fear is not necessarily terror in such an unconscious and pervasive sense, but rather reaction to self doubt.  One doubts the  strength and ability of oneself to uphold the psychological projections, activities, and attachments that constitute the identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage of development the mind has a clear degree of separation from the objective world (nature and culture) but instead of being motivated toward true transcendence of relative and finite bondages, it substitutes the potentially pure understanding and conception of form and idea with a limited and egocentric version that merely gratifies the ambitious and passionate appetites of the limited and separate self sense. Because the will enforces itself through blind attachment, craving, slander, etc., it is very unwilling (and yet incapable) to let go of its egocentricity. Behind all of these instincts for self expansion in the psychic and conceptual arena is the fear that the link between the internal, subjective will and its definitive external attachments will be severed. Fear is this perpetual concern over the loss of self, at least a self defined by its cravings and demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear has many forms and many faces. At the most superficial level, there is fear about the acceptance of the social mask, or persona. Once we find a little more confidence, authenticity and individuality there will still be the fear if this acquired image can be sustained. Even in the highest degrees of development where one begins to have a notion of dharma and the sacrifice of the individual will for the collective welfare there will still be the fear that the lower propensities may hinder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Manipura level is the realm of the self and world that is defined by an impulsive and egocentric will. It is not until the propensities of the Anahata compensate for these limitations that the self begins to intuit that the world and self are not held together only by its own will, but is directed by a divine and moral order. The Manipura can capture this idea.  This understanding is the only way to overcome the fear of losing the grasping, craving and defensive separate self. The only way for the Manipura to be strong and healthy is to serve a master greater than itself. Only through knowing Brahma is there an end to fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the spiritual Warrior archetype is what manifests in the Manipura mental level to guide one toward the spirituality in the Anahata Vortex. Under this influence, which is a co-mingling of Manipura with Anahata and Vishuddha propensities, the mind’s selfish desires get transmuted into a greater effort to struggle to follow one’s conscience. Any Warrior needs a master and the spiritual Warrior archetype is so closely connected to the guru archetype. The Manipura Vortex still can’t let go of images of itself, so it is no surprise that the mind looks for an image or archetype for god. Instead of being lost in the heroic ego trying to free itself from lower worldly bondages, the mind seeks to understand a higher, internal meaning based on a nobler idea than those based on selfish desire, blind attachment and ambition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Hindu epic, the Ramayana, the 10-headed demon Ravana is a symbol for the 10 propensities of the Manipura Vortex. The god Rama is the hero who slays this demon. The Creative  Mind of the Manipura  can grasp these ideals and put them into practice. The divine archetypes descend upon the mind according to time, place, and person. Although most people worship these internal ideas in the extroverted religious sense, the developed Manipura mind understands the true significance of these forms and that they have an archetypal, “guiding function” as Jung termed it. It is this deep understanding of conceptual forms that gives the creative, Manipura mind its genius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a boy I was very curious as to whether Christ really existed as a human being or was a deeper, more universal, spiritual archetype embedded in the human conscience. This curiosity disappeared as I began to meditate and understand that the divine grace is always present behind the tranquil mind. I understood that the divine was in the formless I-Witness of the mind. This is what yogis call the Atman. Words and concepts and even the highest philosophy cannot trap the infinite within their limits. What I longed for was this harmony and union instead of a standardized conception of “god” which always seems to go along with some kind of acceptance of religion, cult or tradition. Although I had so many dreams of my teacher Anandamurti in which He often told me very important things and even healed me, I could never allow my mind to get locked into concepts like “guru.” Perhaps I could accept this authority on the inside, but when people started speaking of “guru” in the social context, it was so often based on other people’s conceptions of what the guru is and not so much their own experience and deep realization. This is true in any form of spirituality: the masses follow set standards and concepts and don’t put much energy into realization. However, it was in the height of my realizations of the formlessness of the divine that I had so many experiences of divine forms! Anandamurti, in dreams or meditation, always guided me toward the formless, actual presence of the Atman and never said anything like “I am the only way.” These experiences always revealed what i saw as deep universal truths. My mind had connected with this particular form that revealed truths so far beyond form. There even once appeared to my physical eyes the luminous form of Christ after a deep meditation. I had no doubt there was a divine presence manifesting as a form. The form vaguely looked like a medieval iconic painting of Andrei Rublev, yet had its own originality.  His form was translucent and the jade serpent that i had seen in my first kundalini experiences was seen just behind his eyes at the level of the mid-brain. I clearly understood that it was a symbol of the union of heaven and earth and of god and humankind. The “serpent power” of the kundalini, the divine energy latent in the base of the spine, awakens into the brain and transforms us into something inconceivable for the Aham. This serpent at the mid-brain was completely tamed and within the beauty of the totality of the beautiful head of the Christ figure. I thought of how such an enlightened brain must have incorporated the so-called reptilian and mammalian brains into the mystical, yet to be realized potentials of the human neocortex that has evolved above and around them. Christ is a symbol of this yogic perfection, at least in my experience. The vision was more beautiful and meaningful than anything I ever saw in the Louvre or any other museum in the world. When I recall it I return to that state of ecstasy in the present. As time goes on I understand this as well as so many other visions of true form as deep spiritual truths that one cannot normally grasp without the help of the medium of form.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I have had some requests to continue writing about my experiences with the yogis in India I met in my youth. I have been requested to speak more about the tips on channelising sexual energy as told to me by the yogi I mentioned in the essay “Form and Formlessness” last week.  I gladly concede to this because I believe that sexuality is one of the least understood subjects in human life.  Sex is a part of everbody’s life, but few have found a tranquil solution to this knotty(no pun intended) subject.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is so much suffering caused by blind sexuality.  So many women are abandoned with children by men whose animal instincts soon pull them elsewhere after a little sensory gratification.  The trail of trauma for the woman may continue as she must struggle to care for the child that have been abandoned.  Or perhaps it was her unfulfilled or frustrated desires that caused the separtion to begin with.  One thing is certain, and it is that there are fewer and fewer examples of harmonious co-existence in human sexual-emotional affairs.  As a culture we have gone back into the stone age as regards to sexuality; only we don’t have giraffs and rhinoceros to chase and hunt down in order to channelize this energy and give us some relief.  Instead there is emerging a whole culture of permissiveness and even indulgence.  In truth, this distortion of the sexual tendency leaves many with very little happiness remaining in marriage or interpersonal relationships.  Conversely, I see very little hope in “free love” and open relationships as well.  While some like the way it sounds in theory, I have always seen that somebody always ends up getting hurt.  What we need is love.  Sexuality doesn’t necessarily have to ruin this but it usually does if one or both people lack insight into what emotive factors are really driving them deep within.  And it is only by going deep within and seeing these needs that one can find fulfillment in sexuality and relationships.  Very few people can altogether transcend these needs.  These people are very rare and very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a very normal sexual orientation in my youth.  Nothing was too extreme, neither repression or expression.  I had everything I needed to live a happy family life by the time I was finishing the university:  a good companion, a good education, and strong adademic interests that inspired future plans.  However, I discovered meditation and yoga in my second to last year,and then got initiated into a very serious tantric practice.  The next thing I knew I was single, just barely graduated the university due to lack of interest, and was on my way to India to find more truth.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was surprising to see how my sexuality began to diminish as I cultivated these practics.  I was still a normal heterosexual; everything still worked, only the fire had died down a little.  The fire was now kindling the desire for deeper spiritual experience.  In those days yoga was still a weird Asian or hippy thing, and not the popular practice that it has become today.  I knew nothing of contemporary yoga.  Fortunately, I learned from some very sincere and serious practitioners from India whom I met at the university.  I was beginning to understand what these older yogis had told me:  that with meditation there is deep insight and this deep insight into the mind and emotions helps one understand not just sex but all mental and biological tendencies.  Tantra Yoga was for me a “libidinal economy,” a way of investing energy in other pursuits.  If you put energy in place B, then it is no longer in place A, the original place. As a psychology student I was very well aware with the concepts of suppression and repression and the illnesses and neurosis that they cause.  Transmutation was a different idea, however.  I never studied this in school.  Freud certainly didn’t grasp this idea.  Perhaps Jung and the humanists did, however.  What impressed me most about Tantra Yoga wasn’t elaborate, sophisticated theories, but the practical results of converting physical desire into mental desire.  And sure enough, my intellectual capacity exploded the more I practiced yoga and meditation and put on the laungota, the yogis loincloth.  Surely you have seen them; the “Tarzan apparatus,” or “organic chastity belt.”  My mind became so sharp, however I was no longer interested in intellectual pursuits.  All that mattered was finding the source of what was summoning me to make all sorts of renunciations that I never thought possible.  Maybe there was some difficulty in the beginning when I was still in the university surrounded by shapely co-eds.  However, for the most part it was a very sweet renunciation with promises of something greater.  I didn’t scorn sexuality.  That would be a direct path to a repressive hell.  I just knew that there was something greater.  The awakening of the kundalini is more bliss than a thousand physical orgasms at once.  And the lover in this tryst is Infinite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem that I had with my new life-style is that I began to become very sensitive to the environment around me.  I began to feel people very deeply.  For example, instead of noticing that somebody was sad by the tone of their voice or facial expression, I began to feel their state of mind.  I would see somebody from far away on campus and get an impression about their state of mind.  What was especially difficult was when I had to share a room with another person.  I always dreamed of their inner life.  I shared my dreams with them and they were really grateful for the insight into their issues.  I once dreamed that I was in a love affair with a girl from Vermont.  We met together in a barn and….  When I awoke I was perturbed because I hadn’t even thought of sex for several months.  I asked myself “why Vermont?  What do I have to do with Vermont?  I remembered that my room-mate was from Vermont.  I asked him if he had a lover there recently.  He just snickered and said, “you caught me!”  I was always very sociable.  However this new energetic sensitivity began to isolate me a little.  However, I had already decided that I wanted to be a monk and accepted this solitary yet blissful position in life.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time I graduated and arrived in India I was having very intense kundalini experiences.  Nobody understood me except my mother and a few close friends.  That soon changed when I arrived at Ananda Nagar.  I felt like I had arrived at a very special learining institution.  It reminded me a little of Hesse’s “The Glass Bead Game” only these men were mystics instead of intellectuals.  They did practical work as well.  The yogi whom I spoke of in last week’s essay administrated a university in the day and meditated all through the night.  It was good to have a reference for work because I had only spiritual desires and didn’t want to do anything else. He was a very advanced meditator and passed through spiritual passions that lasted several years in which he did very little work on the physical plane.  Instead, he was absorbed in the bliss of samadhi.  It is not that he was useless in these times.  Quite the contrary, his elevated vibration inspired many, but also made his little monastic brothers a little jealous of his spiritual achievements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This monk had told me his secrets of transmuting sexual desire on one of our first encounters. He said that he never repressed anything.  I could see that this was true as he was very outspoken.  He openly criticized the crusty theocracy around him and told me with a hearty laugh that Ananda Marga would probably end up killing their own saints some day. He was bold and always expressed himself openly, especially when stubborn or dogmatic people needed a little kick in the rear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He expressed his ideas about sexuality in a similar manner.  If a women’s breasts appeared in his mind during meditation, he just let it happen.  He knew it was impermanent.  He would struggle with the image in his mind, then let his mind enjoy the form.  He still continued to do his meditation during these intrusive “fantasies.”  Slowly his state of formless bliss would return.  He said that eventually he would feel compassion for this person and felt that if this desire manifested he could really harm another person emotionally because he was so god-intoxicated.  He knew that these were momentary inclinations  and that for him to take a lover would be a disastrous existential manuever.  This inspired him to embrace her within a radiant white light and to tell her she was dear to the divine and that he would never harm her.  He said that in the end he always saw his “lover” merging into the pure light of the eternal Atman, and returned to his peaceful meditations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What he told me weren’t some exact, specific techniques to make a desire disapper.  Rather it is an attitude and way of life in general that works to transform the mind and body with their desires.  Few people understand the deep reasons for spiritual discipline and what the yogi truly wants to achieve.  This monk was a robust, intelligent, and even handsome person.  He would have had no trouble impressing the ladies.  He was a far cry from the creepy, repressed preist that negates himself through repression and thereby degenerates his libido into dark perversions.  I truly believe he had developed the “heroic” state of meditation in which there remain very few desires and one thereby begins to let go of all inhibitions.  “All things come from god, how can anything harm me?”  Althought this is the attitude of the “heroic” yogi, it is also the motto of the sensualist who loses his/herself in these very same tendencies. Very few people can really become detached from desire without butchering themselves up on the inside with repressions and distortions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I attach some of my writings from A Name to the Nameless related to this subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sexual-tantra&quot;&gt;Sexual Tantra&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I have got your attention!   When speaking about the second, or svadhistana vortex, most people immediately think of sexuality.  The six vrttis or vortexes of the svadhistana vortex are indifference, depression, compulsion, lack of confidence, paranoia, and resentment.  These 6 tendencies have more to do with a lack of sound grounding in one’s person rather than sexuality.  The sexual drive is rooted in the sensory mind, in the first vortex.  The problem is that due to a lack of awareness of one’s emotional and physical needs, the sexual desire often gets confounded with these defense mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is quite natural and healthy that the sex instinct of the sensory mind finds higher expressions in higher centers.  In a balanced second vortex the sex drive hasn’t reached its full maturity but still is not a blind animal instinct.  It has more to do with emotional security, which is the constant theme when discussing the svadhistana vortex.  The problem is that this biological instinct gets tangled up in the distortions and insecurities of the svadhistana, self-conceptual mind. The ego begins to exploit this gratification for its unconscious necessities and there is always suffering and degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never taken the so-called “sexual tantra” seriously.  Firstly, because the only people who I have ever known to practice such things were never really balanced.  Sure, they spoke of awareness and love and transmutation and all of those nice things, but it was just all too obvious that they were just sex addicts propelled by unconscious emotions.  They always left a trail of harm.  It may be that there were once some more conscious practices that really didn’t trap people into their compulsions, but if they were in fact truthful, then would have to be based on yama and niyama, the ethical base for the practice of yoga.  Most sexual relations ultimately lead one to suffering.  It is a transgression of ahimsa, or no-violence, to project one’s selfish urges onto another.  It is no wonder that in the 2 languages that I understand, the crude word for the sexual act can be  synonymous with the words cheating, deceiving, or generally harming another.
The only functional sexual tantra that I have ever known is to first be responsible and never try to harm anyone while at the same time make the indefatigable effort to try and understand the propensities of the second vortex.  The sexual distortions exploit these fundamental vrttis.  The more suffering, separation, and insecurity that there is in the svadhistana level, the more likely that sexuality will try and compensate for these emotions.    However, these necessities are valid and are so profound and fundamental to the personality that they really need to be understood.  Perhaps the blind compulsions are due to an untimely withdrawal of a mother’s breast that left one sucking in nothingness.  Or perhaps sexuality has aligned itself with an inner, unconscious resentment and lack of confidence that tries to outwardly seduce and dominate through sexual dominance, games, or manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have come to think that when there is no suffering, there is no desire, and where there is no desire, there is no suffering.  This is true for all desires, not just sex.  Few people can really understand this.  Ramakrishna once said that mundane pleasure is like a dog chewing a sharp bone and doesn’t realize the “satiation” of this desire comes from its own blood.  It is fear and insecurity that keep us bound into the limitation of a separate self, and therefore bound to selfish desires.  Sometimes, even very highly developed minds overlook these underlying reverberations in the shadows of the emotions.  The pirates to our present state of bliss are often something unseen from our past.  I have found that the study of the vrttis, especially those of the svadhistana, are paramount for finding the psychological balance that permits intuitive, spiritual development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an excerpt from the “Svadhistana Vortex” chapter of A Name to the Nameless.  The rest of the chapter explores how the 6 propensities of this vortex mask may mask themselves under sexuality.

    &lt;p&gt;“Brahma alone is the guru.” This saying from the Upanishad represents a very universal conception of the deity. Brahma literally means that which is great and makes others great. In other words, Brahma is the Consciousness of the Macrocosm, of the entire universe. The guru is none other than the Supreme Consciousness and cannot be tainted by partiality nor prejudices nor any relative projection of a messiah or human guru. What is, simply is. &lt;!--more--&gt;If the Supreme Consciousness can create this entire universe, then surely there is an unmediated, direct way to communicate with me, a little microcosm in this Macrocosm. “Am I a secluded figure, in the vast, a little ameagre? No no no no I am not alone, the great is with me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one could imagine that such a Macrocosmic deity is not a petty god of a certain country or class or society of exclusive human beings that deserve his mercy. The tiny little human microcosmic mind with its prejudices and attachments finally understands that “god” is not to be found through any finite form, material nor mental. The sacred books and messiahs and Buddhas were just approximations of a an inner, mystical truth. Only those who dare question the root of their being free of these appendages could possibly find the root of their being free of all relative conditioning. Non-dualism, or Advaita, is the idea that ultimately the consciousness of the individual microcosm and the Macrocosm are fundamentally the same. This is not to say that my consciousness has become the consciousness of the universe, that the ego becomes god. Rather, my consciousness has been taken into, accepted, transformed, digested, and finally assimilated into the living, working consciousness of the Macrocosm or Brahma. The microcosm is no longer a separate entity creating negative reactions and contaminating the world while fleeing from one empty dream to the next. The illumined microcosm is a mental cell unified with other mental cells that form a Macrocosm, a collective body of minds. Here, one can’t bring attachments, prejudices, nor any other petty ego control issue. The moment they arise, the Macrocosm knocks you off of your feet. It takes much time and evolution and trial and error to find a flow of unity into the Macrocosm. One must unlearn the socially-conditioned and indoctrinated ego along with all of its hereditary mental and biological instincts in order to learn the ways of Brahma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only those born with developed intuitive faculties can understand these truths without following teachers or paths. Life just somehow teaches these inner lessons. I suspect that these minds are “primed” with this knowledge from birth and that it was probably learned earlier. Plato saw all knowledge as something that has already been learned. What we experience here in the finite world are recollections of truths already known. Genius, according to this view, is nothing more than having at one’s disposal what has already been learned. Spiritual orientation is innately developed in some just as art or music or mathematics is innately developed in others.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p lang=&quot;es-ES&quot;&amp;gt;The idea of a human guru or a spiritual teacher is to help one understand these fundamental cardinal truths of non-dualism. A guru is one who has walked that path and is capable of showing it to others. However, most of the time, a concept of guru is but an opiate for a desperate personality separated from the life of the universe due to its ignorance and egoism. Belief is mostly desperate compulsion and the idea of a guru is often a 2-edged sword. Normally, when people speak to you about gurus they want to sell you on some idea. They often want others to bandy together with them under some omnipotent messiah, guru, and their religion or institution. They don’t really want to have their own experiences but prefer just to adopt the ideas and traditions of others to find security and refuge. The more absolute the idea, the more effective is the opiate and the more placated is the compulsion of the fearful and separate little ego to grasp on to some form of meaning&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one works through these limited ideas of a guru, then perhaps one can really understand something of another human being that is wise and compassionate and only has your well-being in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came to believe that Anandamurti was a true guru. I never met him in physical form. I was convinced of his special character because of his disciples. These exceptional human beings considered Anandamurti as their guru and that naturally gives one a certain reverence toward their teacher. There was once a Sufi teacher who knew of Anandamurti and respected him greatly. He sent one of his disciples to see him. The disciple went to see him but only saw an absurd show of dogmatic followers running about in an absurd guru-devotee show. The master rebuked him and told him he was only judging external appearances. What he should have seen is that the master (Anandamurti) was so great that he accepted all people, even clowns.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p lang=&quot;es-ES&quot;&amp;gt;Fortunately, I made it past the show of spiritual salesmen and was able to meet some of the more mature disciples of Anandamurti, both monastic and lay. In general, the community of Ananda Marga was very respectable. There were people from all strata of society working and moving together under the inspiration of Anandamurti. The problems mostly resided with the monastic institution after the death of Anandamurti. The more mature meditators didn’t have any doubts about the divinity of their teacher but were never dogmatic about it nor tried to impose it on others. They put their meaning in doing practical work and sincere spiritual practice. Near these mature disciples one could feel a certain lightness and expansion of mind that helps one to realize that the guru is deep within, inside of one’s deepest sense of peace. This influence made meditation much clearer and peaceful. It seemed impossible to cling to any form of teacher when one feels at one with the living Macrocosm of Brahma. I began to see an inner light that radiated into every form that entered my mind. I saw the same spirit both within and without. I became certain that I was not my body nor my mind and so how was it possible to cling to some human guru form? However, none of these elder teachers ever tried to impose this form upon me and the stories that I well tell of them will hopefully help other people appreciate the philosophy and spiritual practices of Anandamurti.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p lang=&quot;es-ES&quot;&amp;gt;When I first arrived at Ananda Nagar I met a yogi who told me some very useful secrets. He immediately took me into his confidence. He looked at me intensely and I felt like I was being scanned. The first thing he told me was a tip of how to transmute sexual energies. I had never heard a monk talk about things so openly, yet with such intelligence and purity. Far from being perverse or hypocritical fantasies of a celibate monk, it was the most practical insight into desire that I had heard of in my life. As a young single man I greatly appreciated his insights. The second important thing he told me is that some day Ananda Marga will probably end up killing their own saints. He laughed heartily but he was serious. It was inconceivable to me at the time. Furthermore, it seemed like heresy because everybody else was only talking how great Ananda Marga was and how Anandmurti left all of his power and grace in this organization! Now, 20 years later, I see what he meant.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p lang=&quot;es-ES&quot;&amp;gt;Later, on another visit, he told me how yogis can leave their bodies and travel through the inner dimensions of time and space. He said it was another reality in which there exist not these relative factors of time and space. It was a Dreamland that was even more real than physical reality, a kind of astral repository of all human experience and memory-past, present and future. He said that you could know whatever you needed to know and meet whoever you needed to meet on this plane of reality. I was eager to visit this Hall of the Immortals. He told me how to leave my body and at what time of night I could do it. I left the conversation with a desire to see if I could somehow know something of the teacher of these great men that I was meeting and was inspired by. Later that night I followed the prescribed technique. Nothing happened at that moment. Later I slept and then it started to work. I awoke completely with a holy jolt of spiritual lightning in my spine. I could feel the kundalini rising. I could feel it swishing through the cerebral spinal fluid that was concentrating inside the brain. When it entered inside the head there was only light and sound, every color was within white and every sound within Om. All through the night there was a whirling vortex of energy moving around the crown of my head. It had no form, just sound and color. I was entirely awake but the more the kundalini rose the more I entered into a very conscious state of trance. It was more real than anything I had ever experienced. Rather than a world with forms and mass, all was very fine and soothing vibration. I understood how the crown chakra and the pineal gland were the microcosmic receptor and channel to enter into the formless, infinite Macrocosm. Everything made sense as pure idea. There was no fear or uncertainty of this unknown reality. All was bliss and I felt quite free and pure. I realized that my body was lying on my bed in a trance but that my consciousness was very clearly in the Present without names and forms. Every once in a while I would see the form of Anandamurti and the whole vibrational scene would turn into something more like a dream, only much more real and lucid. I thought “this is a dream”, but I knew it was a very special sort of dream. I still to this day recall it just as clear as a “waking” state of consciousness.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p lang=&quot;es-ES&quot;&amp;gt;To this day I am still trying to realize the significance of these detailed conversations with the guru apparition. Perhaps it wasn’t absolutely necessary for him to appear as a human to another human in a state of lucid dream, but it was a very personal and affective touch from something or someone very sublime. As the years pass by these revelations become even clearer and life makes more sense. There was only so much I could understand as a little spiritual fledgling in my early twenties. They were experiences that by their very nature need a full life-time to be realized. Although I have never preached or tried to convince others about the divinity of Anandamurti, I have never ever doubted this influence in my life. For so many years I didn’t even speak of him. It was a subtle struggle of reconciling form with formlessness, and the idea that the guru archetype may actually appear with a human form. I always considered the latter as a relative possibility and never wanted my experiences to be some kind of “proof” for the ego to make fixed ideas about the infinite. This is a subtle error that causes great damage to an otherwise pure ideology, whether it is one’s personal set of ideas or the ideology of a spiritual society. If mystery, subtlety, and free speculationare substituted by concreteness and conformity, then only dogma will remain. Human beings armed with exclusive ideas always end up creating trouble for themselves and others. I always try to refer to Anandamurti’s philosophical ideas that the Supreme Consciousness is infinite and formless. With those who tried to impose the absolute form of the guru, I only saw religion in the making and soon learned that there was no sense arguing these matters. Over the years I have taught formless meditation with an entirely different system to others without referring to Anandamurti yet many of my students continue to have similar profound experiences and dreams of Anandamurti. It is something that only continues to grow silently inside of me and others. He himself only said that he was, is, and will remain a mystery. However, the philosophy he left is very clear, rational and lucid. I hope others find something special in his works that I am sharing. They were compiled as books, but all of them are based on talks that he gave over several decades to thousands of people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;O yogi, sit in lotus under the sacred neem and together make impenetrable conscious force with nature. The death troopers will receive a great blessing from your practice. Infinite, white burning light penetrates and ignites their darkness. An immediate reaction shakes their world. Those who dealt so much terror may die in terror of Mother Kali, protector of the planet and of yogis. The next embryo they inhabit will finish its recapitulation with gills and fins. There they will “swim in idle waters and drink other fishes piss.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not many people understood the context of these phrases when I published them with this photo last year. It was a very dark time and I remembered a very dark punk rock song from my youth about reincarnation and how Oedipus complex-ridden perverts are reborn as fish. I never thought anything useful would come out of those memories but I realized that they were quite insightful! The narco death soldiers had just returned to the valley. They had come and gone several times in the last few years. Their soldiers get killed off regularly and there were always new ones ready to come and inhabit their nearby camp. There they keep hostages and then kill them and throw their bodies in the mountains.  I welcomed them back with a solo of Gluck’s “Dance of the Blessed Spirits” on my kena bamboo flute. I finished and they returned the message with gunfire. “Okay, now you all want some of my oboe too?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I truly felt protected and I didn’t worry. At first, I saw it as an ideational, meditative stance to create a protective field around our territory so as to keep their evil away. “As you think, so you become,” say the yogis. I won’t even consider it a possibility that they harm us, and so they won’t. However, as I continued to play and further pound them with Gluck and Bach, I realized that I was probably playing requiems for their upcoming departure from the planet. I thought of how those boys were probably forced into the paramilitary part of the cartel and they probably weren’t that different from the rest of the youth in the area. Human beings will do almost anything under forced coercion, at any time and any place. Soldiers hardly ever really know what they fight for. These boys are dying in a war insidiously designed to make Mexicans kill Mexicans while the gringos continue to rob their country blind. The plan is to let the locals do the raping and pillaging while the imperialists purposely take advantage of this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this realization, I played music for them not so much to scare them but to try to send these poor souls something beautiful. If they really are like the youth in this area, then they probably have suffered many deprivations and have never really felt much human warmth and compassion. There are very few nuclear families and almost all heads of the household are alcoholics. There are almost no opportunities for these outcasts. However, the system has designed a strategy to get rid of them and make money selling arms and drugs in the process.
They had already entered the ranch on a few occasions in the past. They are used to people being afraid of them. However, we decided to reprimand them. They were terrified. They said they heard voices in their heads and wanted to leave. They said they would give us their protection. “No thank you,” was the reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t recommend this technique unless one is very fearless and has a really strong mantra! When confronting evil forces that could easily destroy one’s physical being, one’s only protection is innocence and purity. There is fear because there are impurities. We don’t yet fully understand that we belong to immortality and so we attach our identity to some notion of worldly temporality. &lt;em&gt;Sadhana&lt;/em&gt; or meditation burns away the impurities and leads one to a natural state of innocence, at one with nature and spirit. “Who’s universe is this anyway, by what right do these narcos, their narco state and puppet governors have to wield this terror upon us?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Circumstances have given me proof time and again that the only true protection in this world is to be at one with dharma, the moral order of the universe. “Those who protect dharma are protected by dharma.” Dharma is not about beliefs or religion but rather getting to the essence of things by deep contemplation and then know how to react to the situation from this pinnacled, illuminated perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If for some reason I can’t concentrate in meditation, then a little spiritual music or kiirtan always helps. Instead of letting the mind be conditioned by terrible information coming from the world of men and their media, one surrenders to dharma, the silent and natural flow of events in the universe. One can truly feel the harmony of nature and spirit and that the force of &lt;em&gt;dharma&lt;/em&gt;, the conscious force of nature whose only purpose is to serve what is pure and innocent. The best meditation is that which is totally surrendered to Brahma; one desires nothing but simply enjoys being at one with Brahma, the supreme entity. Similarly, the best music is that which is played with spiritual devotion. While in meditation or playing music under the neems or the nearby ceiba tree one totally gets lost in spiritual ideation. With music and meditation along with the protection of the neems and ceiba, one can do the necessary work and create a spiritually-protected atmosphere. To always feel that the Supreme Entity is near and dear, is always loving and looking over, dissipates all fear.&lt;/p&gt;

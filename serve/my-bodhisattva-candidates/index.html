Spiritual vision through the medium of mental forms is truly a form of divine grace. It is a certain
illumination and showering of elevated thought and feeling that is designed by deep Intelligence to
guide us onward and inward. Form helps us eventually understand the formless, the quiet I-Witness
that is always now. Mystical vision is more than mere knowledge. Through it, knowledge is conveyed
but in the most beautiful and meaningful manner. One could never throw such an experience away;
each time it is recalled one gets the original message and merges into silent peace and joy. </p>

<p>I think Tarkovsky was the most mystical “image poet” of modern times in that he really could convey deep
mystical ideas through cinematic form. When I see the last scenes of “Stalker” or “Solaris” I am
deeply moved into an ecstatic reverie and marvel over the experience for hours, amazed that his genius
could express something I always considered beyond expression. That is true poetry. However, even
this beauty is really only an interpretation, and therefore limitation, of inner vision, which is always
ineffable. Great mystic artists give just a little bit of what they inwardly see. Even Tarvovsky’s art
pales in comparison to the truest, sincere vision of even the most humble mind. The kingdom of
heaven is truly within and actively seeks prepared minds in its mysterious, inexhaustible variety of
manifestations.</p>

<p>The other day I woke up just before dawn, I sat up in bed and even before I began to do a little
meditation, I felt a strange vibration on the right side of my head. Inwardly, I looked at it and felt it and
saw so very clearly in my mind’s eye a very gentle and friendly human form. I recognized him. I
knew that this was all going on in the “Magic Theatre” within so I asked this apparition what he was
doing here. No reply, just friendly, loving silence. I reflected and thought “Yes, I know why you are
here. Your humanism moved me deeply and awakened something very profound but I have almost
forgotten its origins and how it came to me in this life. Your Dr. Rieux in “The Plague” asked if it were
possible to be a saint even if there were no god. He sacrificed everything for the well-being of others,
yet he didn’t even believe in god. I always suspected this of you, that you could never put your
compassion under a popular concept of what we call “god.” Those that didn’t grasp your depth called
you an “Existentialist.” The actual human experience of compassion was something so much more
than confusing, corrupt concepts. You initiated me into silent Buddha compassion before I even
became familiar with Buddhist teachings. I suspect that many others were also helped by you, gentle
angel who descended into the “absurd,” the 20th century. Is this where you are now, in this ethereal
space, stimulating neurons of the incarnated so that we don’t forget love? Do you dwell within the
universal spirit, are you just a memory within the collective mind of humanity still bound to this dusty
earth, or just an apparition of my idiosyncrasies trying to make sense of themselves?” The apparition
remains silent.</p>

<p>The form disappears and I feel that same gentle pulsation that was in the left side of my head move into
the right side of the chest, into the Spiritual Heart. Through the Spiritual Heart, mind rises high into a
very fine light that surrounds the planet, a subtle, diaphanous spiritual atmosphere, I look down upon
my valley from so high in this ethereal space. Unlike being in a plane or balloon and resisting gravity,
everything is weightless and the forms are of pure light. The only movements are pulsations of thought
and feeling. He came and showed me his perspective, how he sees things, how the “dead” gaze upon
us, and then returned into the formless. The rocks of the mountains were just reflections of thought, all
is sentient and made of light. Life is inherent in all things. I could vaguely see human faces taking
form out of the mountain rocks. They are rough, turgid and unrefined like Neanderthals but an
invisible force keeps loving them beyond time and form, purifying and refining them into something
greater, beautiful and yet to be completed. An immense love looks down upon the planet and waits for
all life forms to manifest and evolve spirit, slowly.</p>

<p>So was Camus a symbol or a bodiless mind that came to me? It doesn’t matter. All phenomenal
experiences of the mind, even the most spiritual visions, are at best maps and guides, friendly nudges
from the universe to go here or there, or not to. The meaning of the vision is what is important. To feel
at one with the earth, as I did in this experience, is something so profound that even though I write the
vision of Camus off as an hallucination, the inner meaning of the experience is indelibly pressed upon
my mind and I could never deny its beauty and sublimity. The vision inspires great feelings, perhaps
something akin to what the bodhisattvas feel. Microvita are sentient intelligences that exist in the finer,
mental planes of reality. They have many qualities and manifest through various forms of human
nobility, valor, genius, and love. Did Camus express compassion or did Compassion express Camus?
For the non-dualist there really is no difference. All souls are just sparks from the eternal fire of
Brahma. These bodiless microvita guide the evolution of consciousness in all beings on the planet and
even help shape our thoughts and feelings. This physical world really is a reflection of the inner
workings of spirit. Imagination is the key to higher realities, and as Tagore noted, that with more
imagination, the less imaginary something is.</p>

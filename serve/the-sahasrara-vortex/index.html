In Tantra Maya there is only one vortex. It is what corresponds to the
Sahasrara Chakra in Indian Tantras. It is called Hunab Ku, and is considered
the center of the creation. All of the other vortexes located along the spine
are but worlds of vibration, of concentric circles that orbit the cosmic
nucleus of Hunab Ku. All things come from this cosmic nucleus, just as all
comes from the Shiva-Shakti godhead in Tantra. </p>

<p>Sahasrara means a “thousand-petaled lotus.” There are 50 vrttis in the microcosmic mind. They
can express themselves in 2 ways; internally and externally. These two
movements are the 2 petals of the Ajina Vortex, which is really a part of the
Sahasrara Vortex. This is another good reason to remember how all
vortexes are sub-vortexes of the higher ones. These 100 distinct vibrations
are the causal fields behind the 5 sensory and 5 motor organs.
(100x10=1000). There are therefore 1000 petals or vrttis that govern the
microcosmic mind. The Sahasrara lotus is the matrix where all vrttis come
from. It is where the microcosm unites in the Macrocosm. The 2
propensities at the Ajina Vortex are related to the microcosm, but are of the
Macrocosm. Here, there are no propensities of the microcosm, just the
Macrocosmic mental matrix that controls them. In Tantra Yoga, the
Sahasrara Vortex is considered the abode of Shiva, where Shakti, as
kundalini, has subsided her activities of Generating, Operating, and
Destroying the universe. The Sahasrara, therefore, is a divine center that is
capable of controlling the entire mind with its 1000 “cosmic vrttis.” They
are “cosmic” in the sense that these very fine “strings” are played only by
the devas, or “gods” that regulate the entire cosmological order. So, the
Tantra Maya concept of Hunab Ku seems to correspond with the Tantric
notion of the Sahasrara Vortex being a vehicle for the Macrocosmic Mind of
Brahma to govern the microcosmic mind.</p>

<p>Like all vortexes, it is a construct in the chitta that has a
correspondence with the physical body. The Ajina Vortex is related to the
pituitary, “master gland.” The 2 petals of the Ajina control the pituitary
gland, which controls all other glands below. The Sahasrara is related to the
function of the pineal gland. It is only the pineal gland can control the
pituitary gland directly. A nice dose of melatonin secreted by blissful
meditation can really placate all of the activities of the pituitary. And if the
pituitary is controlled directly, then all of the glands in the body are affected
by the pineal gland. All desires are therefore controlled by ideating on
Brahma through the practice of sadhana. I like using the model of one
vortex because it follows in form the cascading effect of the higher glands
over the lower. Chakras, like glands, are a hierarchical network that
regulate our emotive and cognitive states of being. I think of them as one
vortex in the crown with so many concentric circles within. Chakras are just
the subtle counter-part in the “quantum mechanical body,” or mental,
subtle energetic level. Although yogis with concentrated chitta can find any
108nerve cell in the physical brain, the subtle vortexes are used to regulate
brain and endocrine function. While the shaman seeks to induce mystical
states through the science of mystical plants, Tantrics can learn to induce
even deeper states of awareness by ideating on Shiva as the I-Witness
within the Sahasrara, and indirectly create a divine state of intoxication.
Through Tantra sadhana one intuitively fine-tunes a very subtle neuro-
endocrine balance. Besides being drunk with infinite joy, this fine-tuned
brain will naturally be more alert, intelligent, sensitive and conscious due to
these practical effects of sadhana.
Every layer of mind is dependent on the layers above and below it.
The vrttis of a particular kosa compensate and integrate the vrttis of the
kosa, or mental layer, beneath it. At the same time the mind is
unconsciously being prepared, through the unfolding of new propensities,
for the unfolding of still higher compensations and integrations with
successively higher vrttis. No state of mind is permanent and stationary.
Each kosa is part of the great design of the Cosmic Mind. It is a system of
concentric circles, vortexes, or wheels of energy vrttis whose cosmic
symphony is ultimately conducted by the I-Winess. The vortexes, the devas
who control the vrttis, and the endocrine glands do not exist for
themselves, but are links within a greater whole that serve a greater
function. This function is the realization of the Infinite.
At the Ajina Vortex the mind realized that its essence isn’t within mind
itself, nor any of its cognitions. Free will may exist, but any notion of
freedom within the mind will be conditioned by the Macrocosmic Mind
which contains it. True freedom is deep within the Sahasrara in the I-
Witness of Shiva. Recall that mind is a “functional, ever-changing, and
relative entity.” At the Ajina, mind is understood as a functionary extension
and creative outpouring of the infinite and eternal Shiva. At the Sahasrara
Vortex the mind has reached this final destination. While with all of the
other kosas there was a transmutation of the vrttis into successively more
refined states of cognition and feeling, the move from the Ajina to the
Sahasrara represents the complete dissolution of mind itself. It is not the
case that the mind takes refuge in a higher order of mental functioning, like
in the lower vortexes. Rather, it unifies with its fundamental essence and
origin, Shiva. It is here that the binding forces of Shakti have relinquished
the mind from created objectivity and that mind, the subtlest creation of
Shakti, can merge back into Shiva.
This release of the binding forces of Shakti translates, in human terms,
the release of the “I” from any sort of bondage: pain and pleasure, birth and
death, loss and gain. The “I” has become I-Witness. Mahat is converted into
Shiva. Here one realizes that the Self is infinite, unchanging and eternal; it
never underwent any changes or bondages. Actually, it is not even possible
to think these thoughts here. Can the drop of water in the ocean speak of
how it is one with the ocean? Is there still a drop that can say this or has it
become the ocean? In Tantra this state is called Moksha: the complete
109emancipation from any bondage and the merging with Brahma or the
unqualified Shiva-Shakti godhead. This is a state beyond existence, beyond
the universe, and even beyond Brahma: the generator, operator, and
destroyer of the universe. It is the eternal state of rest and refuge for those
minds finished with the cycle of birth and re-birth.
Previously described was the eternal state merging with Brahma with
no return. However, it is possible to temporarily suspend the mind in the
Absolute and then return to the mind and body. This is not Moksha, because
it is not everlasting. This experience of the temporary suspension with the
Absolute is called nirvikalpa samadhi. Much more will be said about
nirvikalpa and other forms of samadhi in the third section, but what is
important to understand here is that the unconditioned and uncreated
Brahma can be experienced without the death of the physical body and
dissolution of mind. It is possible for the mind to come back down into a
refined identity at the Ajina, while experiencing nirvikalpa regularly until the
natural life of the body is over. At that time, one may attain Moksha and
merge with Brahma in the Shiva-Shakti godhead.
Prana, the subtle energy that functions between the mental chitta and
the physical nerve cells, gets suspended during nirvikalpa samadhi. The
breath stops, the heart almost stops and the mind ceases to function
without the pulsation of prana that always flows with the breath. During this
phase before blissful oblivion one can tactually feel a warm glow around the
pineal area in the brain vibrating Om at the tone of C-sharp. The blissful
feeling also descends into the Anahata like a cool balm. All is sweet, one
sees the immortal Self as it always has been. Memories of your past
become memories that the Self had while diving down into your every
unforgettable memory. The infinite being has always lived your life and sees
your every memory from the eternal now of the I-Witness. It fully loves and
accepts and absorbs you because you are It now. Then one forgets
everything and realizes that one has not breathed nor been conscious of
the body nor the outside world for perhaps several hours. I have known
cases of yogis who suspended their breath in samadhi for 10 hours. This is
experiential proof of nirvikalpa samadhi and of immortality the Self who is
verily the great Brahma. In this experience first there is Om, the bliss, the
the opening of Hunab Ku, and then the silence and breathlessness in union
with the mystery of mysteries. In perfect equilibrium, the entire entity of
mind and thus the entire phenomenological identity is suspended in the
Shiva-Shakti godhead.
When I had the great privilege of meeting the sage Chandranath that
experienced nirvikalpa samadhi every time he sat for meditation. I asked
him how it was possible to remain in physical form if one is constantly
merging into the Formless. He told me that he makes a determination
before the experience of samadhi that he will return to his mind and his
body and continue to help others as long as his physical body endures.
Thus, he created a samskara, or subtle desire that keeps the mind bound to
110our world. It is this great and noble determination that kept him from
attaining Moksha before his cycle of existence was complete. He will be
remembered as the greatest sadhaka of Anandamurti.
Some beings that are liberated from their samskaras may choose not
to completely dissolve their minds at death by attaining Moksha Instead,
they hold onto the determination to serve and help all beings find this
liberation. This determination leads to re-birth, but a Bodhisattva birth
without losing the spiritual liberation already attained. Such persons are
born free and the only purpose of their birth is to help others out of
bondage.</p>
